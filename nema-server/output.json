    "fullContent": "\nSummary\nThis proposal is created to further support the mission of a Multichain Uniswap 719. We propose to  the Uniswap community to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\nScroll is an EVM equivalent zk-Rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum. Similarly to Uniswap, Scroll started out working closely with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community, for the community!\nDeploying to Scroll bears many benefits, such as significant savings for users, user base growth, capturing the zkEVM market in advance, and fostering L2 native innovation.\nWe are aligned with Ethereum in our community ethos and vision. We are committed to Ethereum’s decentralized, censorship-resistant and efficient future.\n\nGenerally, we believe that Uniswap’s community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized (financial) infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit and location. In the following we detail Scroll’s architecture and mission. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the community’s questions.\n\nAbout Scroll\nScroll 168 is a native zkEVM 29 Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent ZK-rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security.\nWe have been building in the open from day one, and collaborating on the zkEVM with the PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) group 5 at the Ethereum Foundation. Scroll is aiming at building the best possible solution to scale Ethereum Layer 1.\nScroll is compatible with Ethereum at the bytecode level, which is a major breakthrough in Layer 2 technology and brings huge benefits to the entire Ethereum community:\n\n\nEVM equivalent: Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits.\n\nDeveloper friendly: Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n\nSecurity: Scroll inherits all the features and security of EVM which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space.\n\nDecentralization: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is the only L2 that has committed to outsource proving before launching on mainnet. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem.\n\nAdvance Ethereum’s ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal of “zkSNARK Everything” 64. Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum!\n\nZK-Rollups are widely considered to be the Holy Grail of Ethereum scaling - a best-in-class Layer 2 scaling solution that is very cheap and secure. Scroll’s vision is to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-Rollup that any existing Ethereum application can easily migrate to, thereby helping Ethereum scale without affecting the developer experience. We are live on testnet and will be launching on mainnet once our rapidly growing community of users, developers and auditors battle test the network.\n\nProposal\nBy launching on testnet, Uniswap has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk-Rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols (dapps) who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with an AMM. This is an opportunity for Uniswap to be a strong consideration for these applications.\nUniswap’s multi-chain mission can be facilitated and accelerated by deploying on Scroll in the most seamless way currently possible on Ethereum. Uniswap is a uniquely important DEX in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that an L2 affords.\nUniswap on Scroll will:\n\nBe able to offer high throughput, tps and low gas fees to cater to financial applications which are latency-sensitive such as Uniswap.\nConsolidate the project’s position as an early mover and capture a rapidly growing market in advance as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to a zkEVM focus.\nIntegrate closely with Scroll’s rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to begin deployment within weeks of our initial testnet launch. Projects include Lens, theGraph, Covalent, Empiric, Blockwallet, Ledger, Safe, Orbiter and many more. Based on the excitement around Scroll and zkRollups broadly, we expect over a hundred projects to deploy on our permissionless testnet.\nPropel L2 DEX innovation. We are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now. Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available.\nHelp foster an ecosystem fueled by creativity. Applications (Games, DeFi and more) that have not been seen till now will be deploying on Scroll and having Uniswap on Scroll is mutually beneficial as novel use-cases will use swaps and liquidity pools. Everything from in-game economies to zk-dapps with swap features will have the opportunity to integrate with Uniswap, leading to a new era for application-layer innovation.\n\n\nBridge Security\nZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\nCurrently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase.\nLast but not least, Scroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Its code security is closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Ethereum Foundation and Filecoin. We firmly believe that using such community standards is the most solid way to maintain the security of the codebase and the security of the entire system.\n\nTimeline\nAfter passing the Temperature Check we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll testnet. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks.\nIt is important to us to be closely in touch with the Uniswap community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.\nVoting link: Snapshot 271426",

    "fullContent": "There has been a lot of discussion around whether the “Fee Switch” should be turned on. In most of this discussion I see an assumption that using the fee switch = money going to UNI token holders. I think this is limiting.\nThe design space around how a fee switch can be used is much larger and it’s crucially important to all of DeFi that we consider the design space broadly. Mindlessly adopting a generic “stake UNI = get some sort of fee” would miss the incredible opportunity we have to think creatively about how protocols, governance, and value accrual can work in Web3.\nThe purpose of this post is make clear UNI governance has two very different decisions to make 1). should a fee switch be turned on? and 2) how should fees be utilized?\nBy separating these decisions we may actually be able to move faster.\nThe stakes are high\nUniswap is the #1 DeFi protocol – both in terms of utilization and ethos. What Uniswap chooses to do with the “fee switch” will set precedent for the whole industry. Much like the retro-active UNI token airdrop set precedent for how to distribute governance.\nThe high stakes make complacency a comfortable option but there is equal risk in waiting too long to explore this tool.\nThe “fee switch” Design Space\nI believe the term “fee switch” is a misnomer. It refers to the ability for the Uniswap protocol to retain a portion of what is already being paid to the liquidity providers. The protocol retaining a portion of this gives UNI token holders new tools to leverage in furthering the growth and mission of the protocol. It does not create any expectation the retained tokens will be paid out to UNI token holders.\n\n\nPublic goods funding (thus far the #1 use of the protocol treasury)\n\n\nBuilding protocol owned liquidity\n\n\nFunding grants / developers / etc. for the Uniswap Protocol specifically\n\n\nOther things we can imagine! \n\n\nShould the “fee switch” be turned on?\nI believe the answer to this question is “yes”. It should be turned on in a limited testing capacity. Doing this now will 1) provide us with real data and 2) provide the community more time to consider how assets accrued via this mechanism should be used.\nAt this point, it’s too large of an unexplored design space to neglect. As mentioned already, this will not increase fees for people using the protocol to swap. It will simply retain a small portion of what is currently being paid out to liquidity providers.\nWhat are the next steps?\nUniswap V3 sets fees on a per pool basis. This means we can turn the fees for a limited set of pools. We can analyze the impact this change has and use results to discuss.\nI’m suggesting a simple standard – if trading execution is not diminished for the pools with the “fee switch” turned on – the experiment is a success.\nI suggest we start with two of the largest pools, one stable <> stable pairing and one stable <> volatile. I also suggest we start with the lowest possible setting of 1/10. Based on recent data, these modest changes should accrue $20-$40k per day to the protocol. According to this Dune dashboard 115, total LP fees over the last 7 days have been $9.5 million. Assuming the lowest possible setting (1/10) that’s 950k per week the protocol hypothetically could be accruing. The cost of inaction is high.\nSpecification:\n\nUSDC / ETH @ 0.05%, initialize 1/10 “protocol fee”\nUSDC / USDT @ 0.01%, initialize 1/10 “protocol fee”\n\nFeedback!\nThis is an important decision, let’s discuss!\nIn accordance with governance procedures, I’ve created a temperature check vote here: Snapshot 63930",

Incentivizing LPs to lock their liquidity within specific ranges for certain periods of time would make Uniswap TWAP oracles provably harder to manipulate (ref: https://blog.euler.finance/eulers-oracle-risk-grading-system-93f47d68205c 8). Safer oracles would make it easier for lending protocols to adopt Uniswap TWAP oracles instead of relying on more centralized solutions like Chainlink.\nI think it could be an interesting way to experiment with the fee switch for the following reasons:\n\nSafer oracles would benefit the whole DeFi space;\nOver time this initiative could lead to Uniswap TWAP oracles becoming the gold standard in DeFi;\nAll of the fees would still go to LPs, therefore potentially limiting the loss of pre-existing LPs as the fee switch is enabled;\nThe fees would compensate longer focussed LPs over Just In Time liquidity providers;\nThis initiative would be quite easy to roll back if it fails vs paying $UNI holders a dividend.\n\nJust my two cents.

        "replyFullContent": "I’m from Gamma Strategies, which is an active liquidity manager on Uniswap v3, and I will say that USDC / ETH is one of the hardest pairs to be profitable on due to the lack of correlation between the two assets which leads to higher impermanent loss.  The fees are desperately needed to offset any IL in that pair.  So, I would not take fees away from USDC / ETH.  It’s one of Uniswap’s most dominant pairs, and any fees taken away from that pool will likely diminish Uniswap’s market dominance.\nUSDC/USDT 1 bps fee tier pool is extremely dependent on fees to make a respectable profit as well.  The margins are razor thin already.  Curve and CEXes also do offer respectable competition for these swaps.\nI guess the main purpose of this test is to see how much liquidity would leave after implementing a fee switch?\nI think that’s a dangerous game.  The AMM design of Uniswap v3 was genius in that the concentration of liquidity allowed it to have an amplified effect, which got Uniswap 80% trade volume market share on a fraction of the TVL, but I don’t think it should get too cocky or complacent with that lead.  Other AMMs like Curve v2, Sushi, Quickswap, Orca, and Shell Protocol are all developing their own concentrated liquidity platforms, which will likely make some dent in the trade volume market share of Uniswap in the future.\nUniswap seems to be very well capitalized and endowed with a lot of funds for protocol development.  They even have enough funds to make venture investments of its own.\nSo why is this needed?  Protocol owned liquidity is great, but it need not come from the fees.  I would rather see Uniswap fund these developments via providing liquidity in their own pools.  There are plenty of stable-stable pairs where good income can be made through either incentives programs provided by other protocols (such as Frax Finance and Angle Protocol, which offer double digit yields on Uniswap’s stable-stable pairs) and via leveraged stablecoin liquidity providing.  Thus, I’d rather see Uniswap bring in this income via liquidity providing in their own pools versus taking fees away from the LPs.  Its double benefit that way where you increase Uniswap’s liquidity and maintain a competitive edge over other AMMs that are vying to take market share away from Uniswap.",

Those fees are often the difference between profit and loss.  LPing on V3 is already challenging enough. I can understand concentrated liquidity managers and others building on top of Uniswap charging fees for managed services. But the base layer? 10 percent of all fees?!\nJust like in government or business, if you’re going to create taxes or fees that make you less competitive and less capital efficient, you should probably have a rigorous plan of how you wish to spend those funds.

The risk in my opinion doesn’t necessarily come from the action of turning on the fee switch itself, and indeed I think that liquidity providers should build their businesses around the assumption that that happens some day in the future.\nInstead, I think the decoupling of two distinct but related questions (“Can the protocol charge fees” and “What will the protocol do with the fees that it earns”) is where the danger lies. Uniswap’s governance is still in its formative stages and though the past year has seen some positive outcomes, kicking the can down the road and trusting that we’ll figure out how to manage and deploy this income stream is not a good look. It’s irresponsible to make a foundational shift in the economics of an entire set of users without telling them why that shift is being made.\nAnd this is not even taking into account the regulatory risk to token holders which, \\ __o __/, I’m not qualified to speak on.\nWith that said, there is definitely an opportunity to fund research around this topic so that we can make a more comprehensive plan on how to change a key tenet of the biggest dex in the market and arguably the most important protocol on Ethereum. Off the top of my head, I’d like to have as a start:\n\na framework for categorizing pool types. @wilsoncusack gets at this a bit in his post but I think a more rigorous quantitative and qualitative definition would be useful in figuring out a) how to test and b) assuming test results positive, how to roll out to all existing pools\na plan for converting long-tail shitcoins into useful stables (a la 1Inch) and a backtest run on that plan including a sensitivity analysis on what happens when LPs leave in varying quantities.\n\nI would be hugely supportive of anyone that wants to propose that type of research and am happy to be a sounding board for anyone that’s thinking along those lines.",

        "replyFullContent": "TL;DR: I am 100% supportive of this proposal to add the 1/10 protocol fee to a selected number of “sister” pools.\nI propose to first activate it for the following pools:\n\nDAI-ETH-0.05%\nUSDT-ETH-0.3%\nUSDC-ETH-1%\n\nThe Uniswap Grants program (or internal research) should then study the effects of the protocol fee on LP revenue to guide the general decision-making process for fee activation.\n\n\nI think a major consideration here is whether or not liquidity providers remove liquidity as a result.\n\nThe impact on the revenue liquidity providers for doing so will be minimal, here’s why.\nFirst, one has to understand where fees come from. While fees obviously result from trading activity, the way orders are routed play an important role in how much volume each pool gets.\nTransactions will always be routed to the pool that minimizes the slippage, which means that the 0.05% fee pool will “allow” more transactions through because it will always capture all transactions between 0.05% and 0.3% slippage limit.\nWe can see the price of each pool and the number of transactions in each pool for the ETH-USDC pools:\n\nimage1920×1053 93.9 KB\n\nNote how the price in the lower left panel is much finely-grained for the 0.05% than for the 1% pool. However, the 1% pool sees larger jumps between trades. But each of these pools should track the same price and, by association, each pool should have the same properties, including the fees collected and the price’s realized volatility.\nHow does volatility relate to LP revenues? I explicitly derived this relationship between volatility (which is related to expected revenues), feeTier, liquidity and dailyVolume in several post (this post 4 is the most relevant), and it is given by\n\nimage1400×221 68.8 KB\n\nwhere gamma γ is the feeTier+protocolFee, and LP revenue is ~Impl.Vol * √timeInPool\nTherefore, regardless of the feeTier+protocolFee, each pool of the same asset pair should generate the same amount of fee per unit of liquidity. An intuitive way to think about this is that if PoolA generates less revenue than PoolB, then rational LPs will relocate their liquidity to PoolB to capture that edge.\nThis is also true if we look between the ETH-stablecoin “sister pools” like ETH-USDC/DAI/USDT: they should all generate the same revenue as long as the keep the same peg, and that means they should all have the same implied volatility.\nIs this really a valid assumption? If we look at the implied volatility as derived above for all ETH-stablecoin pairs, we see that the IV for all pool are somewhat consistent at around 130% for most pools:\n\nimage1920×995 92.2 KB\n\nhint: rational LPs should re-deploy liquidity to the high IV pools to maximize revenue\nThere are a couple of outliers, but let me focus on the USDC/ETH pools:\n\nUSDC/ETH 0.05%: IV = 116%\nUSDC/ETH 0.3%: IV = 131%\nUSDC/ETH 1%: IV = 125%\n\nWhile each pool has a different feeTier, transaction routing means that each pool gets a different amount of daily volume, and this daily volume is matched by a different amount of “tick liquidity” that minimized slippage. This, in a way, magically brings them all within a similar implied volatility and LP revenue range, but there is no clear trend (we have IV: 0.3% > 0.05% > 1%, but volume is: 0.05% > 0.3% > 1% and tickTVL is: 0.3% > 1% > 0.05%).\nHence, I predict that activating a 1/10 protocol fee to any one of those pools would re-shuffle some of the liquidity provisioning, but all pools will still converge to the same IV and LP revenue at the end of the day.\nSo, I propose that the Uniswap Governance enables the 1/10 protocol fees for a few ETH-stablecoin sister pools and use the Uniswap Grants program (or internal research) to study the effects of the protocol fee on LP revenue.\nThe pools could be:\n\nDai/ETH 0.05%\nETH/USDT 0.3%\nUSDC/ETH 1%\n\nOr any combination of ETH-stablecoin pools across non-overlapping feeTiers.",

        "replyFullContent": "Super interesting discussing so far! Two things, I’d like to add:\n\n\nWe’ve recently done some research related to the fee switch question. More precisely, we modelled how high the take rate (or “protocol fee”) should optimally be. For more details, see this post: Research on the Fee Switch 27\nThat being said, for the beginning, the lowest possible value, i.e. 1/10 = 10%, as suggested by the proposal, is probably a good choice.\n\n\nOne crucial question that could be answered by experimenting with the fee switch, is measuring how strong Uniswap’s moat is over other DEXs. (In a fully rational market, the DEX with the lowest protocol fee should attract most liquidity and volume. But in reality, Uniswap, as the clear market leader, likely has an competitive advantage over other DEXs, and can afford a higher protocol fee. The question is, by how much?)\nHowever, one Uniswap v3 pool of course has no moat over another. So this effect could not be measured, if the fee switch is only flipped for one fee tier for a certain pair.\nInstead, flipping the switch for all fee tiers for a certain pair could be considered (maybe for a “less important” token pair?).\n\n\nFinally, a more philosophical thought \nIn the long run, it might be inevitable that a part of trading fees goes to UNI token holders - simply due to the fact that exactly these token holders can decide on the matter.\nThe longer token holder receive no rewards, and the lower the expectation of this happening in the future becomes, the more the value of UNI tokens declines. Until at some point, it becomes cheap enough for someone to buy a sufficient amount of UNI tokens to vote to distribute fees to token holders (including themselves).",

    "fullContent": "This post is co-written with @guil-lambert\nIn July of 2022 a proposal was put forward to pilot turning on the “fee switch” for a small set of Uniswap protocol pools. A temperature check passed 98 and a consensus check 98 also passed voting.\nDuring the process, many people voiced a desire to have more time to research this proposal before voting. In light of that, the vote was postponed until December 1st 42. This pause led to helpful research from Alastor 55 as well as input from the newly created Uniswap Foundation 51.\nNow that it’s December 2nd, the vote is moving forward! The purpose of this post is to re-iterate key points of the proposal and next steps so the community can be ready!\n\nKey Proposal Points:\nThe rationale behind the proposal remains the same. For clarity, we are stating a few of the key points here but it’s recommended to read the original post 71.\n\n\nThis proposal is solely designed to test the impact of the “fee switch” on protocol usage. The proposal does not dictate how any tokens retained during this period are used (or if they ever will be used). The proposal does not create any expectation the retained tokens will be paid out to UNI token holders. On the contrary, this proposal advocates that if future proposals use accrued tokens, that use be restricted to public good purposes for the community and to grow the Uniswap protocol.\n\n\nThis proposal is truly designed as a pilot program intended to evaluate the impact of turning on the fee switch on trade execution.\n\n\nTurning on the fee switch will not increase fees for people using the protocol to swap. It will simply retain a small portion of what is currently being paid out to liquidity providers.\n\n\nTo limit the potential impact of the pilot program on liquidity providers, we are proposing to activate the lowest possible settings for the “Fee switch” (1/10) on a limited subset of pairs (ETH-stablecoin “sister pools”) and for a limited time (120 days).\n\n\nThe metric to measure success of the experiment is the following: If trading execution is not diminished for the pools with the “fee switch” turned on – the experiment is a success.\n\n\n\nProposal Settings:\nWe thank the Alsator team for the thorough and comprehensive “Uniswap Fee Switch Report” which has been released earlier this month (link to the report: Uniswap Fee Switch - Alastor Report (11.14.2022).pdf - Google Drive 125). The key takeaways from the report are that the fee switch should be designed to grow both volumes and market share of the Uniswap protocol. We wholeheartedly agree with this goal and we are sure most UNI stakeholders will be guided by similar principles.\nHowever, we chose not to follow their recommendation to not turn on the fee switch for any of the “lower fee tier” pools. Their report argued that doing so could decrease Uniswap’s volume and market share, but at this point we are frankly unsure if anyone knows whether that would be the case.\nThey also made the observation that “sophisticated” LPs often sit in lower fee tiers, which by association also suggest that the retail-level LPs sit in the higher fee tiers. Hence, only targeting the higher fee tiers could disproportionately impact smaller players. We believe the community would agree that the fee switch should not negatively impact retail users while at the same time favor sophisticated LPs.\nIn addition, several users raised concerns about turning on the fee switch for the ETH-Dai 5bps pool. As per the Alastor report, the ETH-Dai pairs collectively have the least amount of liquidity amongst the ETH-stablecoin pairs, and we agree that targeting the ETH-Dai 5bps fee tier, which has the most volume, could negatively impact liquidity providers at all levels.\nWe thus decided to follow @alanalevin suggestion to use the ETH-USDT-0.05% as a possible alternative to the ETH-Dai-0.05% pool.\nTherefore, we propose to set Fee parameter to 1/10 for the following pairs:\n\nETH-USDT-0.05%\nDAI-ETH-0.3%\nUSDC-ETH-1%\n\nAll accrued protocol fees will remain “uncollected” inside each pool smart contract until governance agrees on best use for funds via a vote.\n\nProposal Success Metrics:\nThe metric to measure success of the experiment is the following: If trading execution is not diminished for the pools with the “fee switch” turned on – the experiment is a success. Note that this criteria explicitly does not consider the impact of the fee switch on liquidity provider returns.\nMore intangibly, we hope this proposal helps catalyze robust discussion and work around Uniswap, the world’s most successful decentralized finance protocol. We hope this work is broad and creative, showing the world what new models of coordination are possible.\n\nTimeline:\nWe anticipate the on-chain vote going live in the next 14 days. We are currently doing technical diligence to ensure the proposal itself is formatted correctly. We will post this code when it is ready for additional review by the community\n\nDisclosures\nThe authors of this post hold no UNI tokens nor have any price exposure to UNI via alternative methods (i.e. margin, leveraged trading, etc.).1 Reply25",

        "replyFullContent": "Excellent question!\nWe expect some LPs will remove liquidity from the fees switched pools to another pool. This is totally understandable and expected to happen. But how would that liquidity affect the execution price?\nIn other words, if liquidity is moved from the 30bps pool to an identical price range in the 5bps pool, would that increase the slippage for the average trade? The swap router could alleviate some of the inefficiencies by re-directing trades to the “most liquid” pool, but I’d say the actual impact of that liquidity re-deployment is largely unknown.\n“Trade execution” could thus be monitored by tracking the (slippage+fees)/tradeSize for all ETH-stablecoin trades that went through the SwapRouter before and after the fee switch. This would basically track whether the “effective” liquidity of the whole protocol went up/down or stayed the same. We’re open to other ideas as well.\nAt the end of the day, we first and foremost want to focus on studying the impact of the fee switch on trade execution for swappers, and not on its impact on LP revenue.",

Who trades on DEX? How do people trade on DEX? Isn’t the DEX volume mostly automated? Isn’t DEX volume mostly related to Arbitrage and MEV opportunities?

        "replyFullContent": "Hi Uniswap community. I’d like to share my thoughts on this proposal as I think it is a very important moment for Uniswap. I come here as someone who wants to see DeFi succeed and sees Uniswap as integral to this. The research by Alastor and the Uniswap Foundation has been excellent and should be used to continue to drive discussions on the fee switch, but I think now is the wrong time to execute this proposal.\nFirst, I feel for the Uniswap community who may be hurting due to price action of the UNI token. The crypto markets are down and the Uni token is as well. It is natural to want to pursue changes when things seem like they are not going well. In this situation, however, I think that inaction is the best action.\nThere are two core reasons why I think this is not a good idea. First, I think a fee switch would be counterproductive to the objectives identified by Alastor. I fully agree that TVL, market share, and trading volume growth should be the Uniswap Protocol’s top priorities in this phase of its lifetime. While we may identify that the fee switch does not or has minimal negative impact on these metrics for certain pools, taxing LPs certainly cannot help here. I see only downside across the core KPIs.\nThe other reason is that this proposal could have very serious and unpredictable negative externalities for the Uniswap community. The Uniswap Foundation’s brief discusses the severe lack of clarity for DeFi in the U.S. It is very possible that this proposal could negatively impact community members like Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and even individuals in the community. I don’t think the proposed exploration is justifiable amidst these uncertainties.\nThe community treasury is large and there is no lack of funding for growth initiatives. There is no need to risk stifling growth or any other consequences right now.\nToday UNI is the single most valuable DeFi governance token by market capitalization. This isn’t because of the prospect of immediate cash flows. It is because the token marks ownership in a decentralized community for the single most revolutionary and useful protocol in all of DeFi. The Uniswap vision is far bigger than a fee switch. It should not be jeopardized or hindered at this point in the protocol’s lifetime for the exploration of unnecessary fees.\nDisclosure\nI do not hold any UNI nor do I have any exposure to UNI. This is not financial or legal advice. I am only providing my thoughts on this unprecedented initiative and will support the Uniswap community in its decision.",

        "replyFullContent": "At GFX, we’ve been working towards getting the Fee Switch turned on for more than a year and, over the last several months, have been slowly gathering opinions from delegates and UNI holders. Our general observation has been that most UNI holders are interested in seeing the protocol monetized. The differences in opinion tend to come from when and how the protocol should be monetized. Some believe it should be put off until Uniswap gains greater market share, while others believe that monetizing the protocol today could rekindle interest in the protocol, governance, and UNI. Over the last six months, there has been a jump in interest in getting the switch activated, and now how has become the main question.\nThe how (implementation) generally consists of the flowing questions (ignoring v2 to simplify this):\n\nWhich pools should protocol fees be turned on for?\nWhat should the protocol fee be set to?\nHow will the protocol set the fees?\nHow will the protocol claim the fees?\nHow will the protocol manage the positions it will accrue?\nWhat will the protocol do with its revenue?\n\nHowever, those questions only address the technical implementation of the Fee Switch. There are several legal questions we’ve come across that voters would like to see addressed, such as the following:\n\nIs Uniswap responsible for paying income taxes (and other potentially relevant taxes)?\nDo UNI voters need to come up with their own process to assess whether assets in the protocol are or aren’t securities similar to traditional exchanges?\nWhat might happen if Uniswap generates fees from a pool that contains an asset designated as a security?\n\nWe think there are certain ways to activate the Fee Switch, which could maximize the value of the protocol while minimizing legal risks.\n\nThe metric to measure success of the experiment is the following: If trading execution is not diminished for the pools with the “fee switch” turned on – the experiment is a success.\n\nWe’ll be voting against the proposal if it progresses to a formal governance vote because we believe the primary metric of success is unlikely to be met with the proposed implementation. Additionally, the proposal needs to address the above key questions. The below explains why we believe success is unlikely; we can make a follow-up post regarding why the proposal doesn’t sufficiently address the above question if it needs to be clarified.\nWhile some may say that the proposal is merely an “experiment,” an unsuccessful implementation will likely hinder future efforts to monetize the protocol and reflect poorly on the state of Uniswap.\nQuestion: Why do we think the proposal will not meet its stated success metric?\nIf passed, the proposal will set a protocol fee of 1/10 of the fee tier of the pool for the designated pools: ETH-USDT 5bp, DAI-ETH 30bp, & USDC-ETH 100bp. For example, the USDC-ETH 100bp pool applies a 100bp fee to trades and distributes the full fee to the LPs. With the fee applied, the fee on swaps remains the same, but the fee to LPs drops to 90bps.\n\nNecessary context:\nThe protocol has four fee tiers: 1bp, 5bp, 30bp, and 100bp. Each asset pair can only have these four fee tiers; no additional pool can exist. For example, there is one ETH-USDC 1bp pool, one ETH-USDC 5bp pool, one ETH-USDC 30bp pool, and one ETH-USDC 100bp pool. If someone were to try to make a second ETH-USDC 30bp, the factory contract would prohibit it. If someone tried to make the inverse pair like USDC-ETH 30bp, the factory contract would also prohibit it.\nTo help normalize this information, its best to view them in a familiar format:\n\n\n\n\nTiers\nTaker\nMaker\n\n\n\n\n100bp\n1.00%\n-1.00%\n\n\n30bp\n0.30%\n-0.30%\n\n\n5bp\n0.05%\n-0.05%\n\n\n1bp\n0.01%\n-0.01%\n\n\n\nTakers are people swapping with the pool, whereas the Makers are the LPs in the pool. Makers are currently receiving a 100% rebate for liquidity provided.\nAnswer: By introducing a 1/10 Protocol Fee on select pools, the protocol is reducing the rebate the LP will earn. Further, by only introducing the Protocol Fee to select pools, active LPs will likely move to one of the other three fee tiers where the rebate remains 100% or will move to a like-kind pair.\nFor example, if we were an active LP in the ETH-USDT 5bp pool and saw a rebate reduction of 10%, but the ETH-USDC 5bp still offered a 100% rebate, we’d simply move to that pool instead.\nPotential alternatives\nBelow are our brief thoughts on implementing a Protocol Fee for the purposes of analyzing changes to LP behavior and swap execution. The list is from the most optimal implementation to the least optimal implementation to active Protocol Fees.\n\nSet a single fee for all Uniswap deployments: leaving LPs the fewest alternatives\nSet a single fee for a single deployment: LPs could move to another deployment\nSet a single fee for a pair, and it’s like kind pairs: the LPs could move to other assets\nSet a single fee for a select few pairs: the LPs could move to like-kind pools\n\nCall to action\nIf you’re a UNI token holder and supportive of a thoughtful proposal to turn on the fee switch, please reach out.\ngovernance@gfxlabs.io",

        "replyFullContent": "Hello Uniswap community.  Let me start by saying I support this proposal as written.  It represents a first step towards learning how to safely charge fees on Uniswap.  There is still plenty more work to be done after using intelligence gained from the trial.\nThis is a pilot.  The decision should come down to:\n\nWhether it will further intelligence by learning something about the protocol?\nWhether this something is worth knowing?\nWhat are the costs associated with running the pilot?\n\nThe focus of this proposal is narrow.\n\nThe proposal is solely designed to test the impact of the “fee switch” on protocol usage.\n\nObserving the reaction of liquidity capital (taking broader market conditions into account) will be useful in assessing how bearable fees are on Uniswap v3.  I have little confidence that anyone knows how LP’s will react.  Uniswap is a marketplace.  There are extremely complex dynamics affecting behaviors.\nIf fees do turn significant capital away from these pools (or spread out over wider ticks, who knows) then it is worth learning that and improving in future tests.  The only way to truly find out is in a live simulation.  There is also a predefined end to the pilot.  Importantly, the default is not to continue indefinitely.\nAs I see it the costs are the risk that one or both of the following happen:\n\nCapital permanently leaves these pools.  All else equal that widens Uniswap v3 spreads relative to alternatives.\nLegal issues.  I’ll leave that to someone who knows what they’re talking about.\n\nThe recent average TVL of these three pools together is approximately $70mm TVL combined relative to Uniswap v3 Ethereum’s $2.6bn.  This represents 2.7% of TVL compared to an average standard deviation of the change in TVL of around 5%.  The benefit of learning the effect on the Uniswap protocol in a controlled, time limited trial is worth risking a small percentage of this TVL.",

In general, Alastor supports moving forward with a fee switch pilot program, even if it doesn’t necessarily match our specific recommendations verbatim. A few additional thoughts from the Alastor side of things:\nRegarding Pilot Pools - While we stand by our stance that implementing the fee switch on lower fee tier pools creates perverse incentives for LPs relative to the overall goals of the community, we are not against including one of these pools in a pilot to test this thesis. That said, we would recommend using the 0.05% ETH-DAI pool rather than 0.05% ETH-USDT pool as the 0.05% test case. Our rationale:\n\n\nETH-USDT makes up the largest ETH-Stable spot-trading market in the world today (~3x the volume of ETH-USDC across both DEX/CEX competitors), of all ETH pairs Uniswap should be targeting this volume rather than disincentivizing its most efficient liquidity\n\n\nRelatedly, Uniswap decentralized market share in ETH-USDT is much lower than that of the other two ETH-Stable pairs being considered (~50% against, versus >90% in both ETH-USDC and ETH-DAI)\n\n\nWhile the ETH-DAI pools do indeed have smaller TVL than ETH-USDT, they are similar when normalized against volume serviced\n\n\nUltimately, we believe that it would behoove the community to utilize ETH-USDT as the primary test case to see if market share can truly be improved by utilizing the fee switch as an LP incentivization tool given the market share runway that currently exists.\nRegarding Tracking & Measurement - To echo @msilb7, we would strongly encourage defining decentralized volume market share as the primary measurement of success for this pilot. We also would recommend (at a bare minimum) tracking order volume prior to and during the pilot program as well as tracking TVL flow, on both an aggregate and on an individual level in the days and weeks following implementation. It is important that the ramifications of this pilot not simply be considered anecdotally.",

That’s because over the long run, I view protocol fees as the principal way for the protocol to support itself in a sustainable manner.\nHaving said that, I think we need to understand the tax impact before we turn on the fee switch.\nSimply put, turning fees on will generate revenue for the protocol (even if the accrued fees are not paid out to tokenholders). As I see it, the known unknown is “who will cover the potential tax bill on profits generated by the protocol?”\nBefore we have a better answer to this question, I don’t think it’s wise to turn on the protocol fee switch.",

However, it has not yet deployed its protocol to the second-largest blockchain infrastructure by volume and user base, BNB Chain. This represents a missed opportunity for Uniswap to expand its reach and potentially drive further growth and adoption of DeFi.\n\nProposal\nThis proposal will authorize 0xPlasma Labs to deploy the Uniswap v3 protocol to the BNB PoS Chain on behalf of the community.\nWe believe this is the right moment for Uniswap to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).\n\nUniswap v3 current stats\nTotal Value Locked - $2.6B\nChain Breakdown\nEthereum - $2.37B\nPolygon - $99.84M\nArbitrum - $84.9M\nOptimism - $44.53M\nCelo - $865.4K\n\nPotential TVL + LP Fees from BNB Chain -  50% * $2.73B (PancakeSwap)\n\nUniswap v3 volume on Ethereum chain\n\nimage3354×1400 503 KB\n\nSource: Dune 24\n\nBNB Chain current stats\nBNB Chain is a decentralized, public blockchain that operates using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

At a high level, the HyperLoop protocol works by utilizing a network of Executors to observe and attest to messages on a source chain and relay those attestations to a destination chain. “WatchTower” node can disconnect Executors from the HyperLoop protocol if fraudulent attestations have been detected, and utilize Executor stake to payout for transactions on the destination chain.\nA general L1<>L2 and L1<>L1 communication HyperLoop bridge supports arbitrary message passing.\nMore info on the HyperLoop protocol security:\nThe HyperLoop bridge supports generalized message passing, asset bridge, and swap (using Uniswap v3 and HyperDEX routers) for all supported EVM and non-EVM chains.\nApplications using HyperLoop are secured by a set of WatchTowers, responsible for detecting fraud in the network. Only one WatchTower needs to be honest for the application to be safe. Instead of a consensus type of bridge, HyperLoop utilizes the over-collateral lending nodes and on-chain whitelists for the Executors.\nBridge Executors can’t pass an incorrect message or change the content. Importantly, we’ll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity.\nSecurity is top of mind for 0xPlasma. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for HyperLoop and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program.\nYou can read more about HyperLoop Bridge&Swap protocol here 44.\n\nWe would also like to discuss with the Uniswap Community the pros and cons of different ETH<>BNB bridges.\n\n\n0xPlasma Labs Contribution to Uniswap v3\n\nHyperDEX aggregator supports routing via Uniswap v3\nHyperLoop cross-chain swap&bridge based on Uniswap v3 liquidity\n\nQuadrat 34 Protocol - active liquidity management for Uniswap v3 positions\nMulti-chain Portfolio Management on Plasma.Finance 12 supports Uniswap v3 position NFTs\n\n\nLicense Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the “Deploy Uniswap V3 Script. 20” 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.\n\nTimeline (5-7 weeks)\nWe anticipate deployment of the smart contracts on the BNB Chain to take a few weeks. Additionally, Uniswap Labs has noted that they will need to complete some front-end updates and add the BNB chain to the auto-router — this will take ~4 weeks and they are prepared to ramp up following Uniswap community approval of this governance proposal.\nGovernance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge HyperLoop (or using any other native bridge that we discussed with the Uniswap Community).\n\nDiscussion on Governance Forum / Twitter Space\nUniswap v3 + Governance Bridge Deployment on BNB Chain Testnet.

The parameters of the smart contracts, such as fees, chains, and list of validators, are managed by deBridge governance.\n\n\nInfrastructure Layer (off-chain) – nodes run by validators elected via deBridge’s governance. These validators also run full nodes on all the blockchains supported by deBridge.\n\nimage1400×438 78.2 KB\n\n\n\nAccording to the cross-chain Deployment Proposals Framework, here are answers to the Bridge Security questions in the context of deBridge:\nDoes the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\nYes, deBridge infrastructure supports any message transfers and has delivered 126,000+ messages since its launch in February 2022. Details of any cross-chain transfer through deBridge’s infrastructure can be accessed by anyone on deExplorer 3\nIs the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or by a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?\nValidation of any cross-chain transactions goes down to social consensus around forks. That’s why canonical or trust-minimized bridges based on light or full clients are possible only between two blockchain ecosystems (normally L1 and L2) as if there is a fork in L1, then there is a fork in L2 and users can always pick which of the forks to use.\nNon-canonical interoperability layers and bridges can’t be fully trustless by their nature, due to the need to have a validation layer that should at least determine which of the forks is valid and supported by the community, so it’s all a matter of how this validation layer is implemented.\nDifferent protocols have different implementations, such as:\n\nOracle and relayer model\nOptimistic approach\nZk or Succinct proofs\nSet of validation nodes\n\ndeBridge validation layer uses a “delegated staking and slashing” with a set of validation nodes, optimizing for security and speed. All validators are elected by and work for deBridge governance. To be confirmed, a transaction must be signed by at least ⅔ of the validators, i.e., 8 out of 12. The validators are disincentivized to act maliciously as they bear financial risks through a delegated staking and slashing module.\ndeBridge plans to scale its validator set, increasing the threshold of signatures required for message validation, and thus enhancing the protocol’s overall security.\nThanks to off-chain validation 3, the validators don’t need to communicate with each other, thus their IP addresses are never exposed, increasing the overall security of the infrastructure.\nDoes the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity?\nAs described in the previous paragraph, any bridges and interoperability layers (except canonical ones) have to rely on the validation layer. deBridge leverages professional infrastructure providers to validate cross-chain messages passing through deBridge protocol.\nIs it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?\nIn order to forge a message, ⅔ of deBridge validators would need to collude and each one would need to provide a signature of the malicious message identifier. deBridge validators are professional infrastructure providers that validate many other protocols and blockchains. All validators bear reputational and financial risks\nWhat are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?\nThe validators are disincentivized to act maliciously as they bear financial risks for their service as per the delegated staking and slashing module 1.\nHas the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?\nSecurity has always been the top priority for our team. deBridge and its’ periphery modules have been audited 17 times 1 by Halborn, Zokyo, Ackee Blockchain, and Neodyme. Additionally, deBridge offers a $200,000 bounty program on Immunefi. All the findings and remediations can be seen in the published security audit reports available in the public Github repository 1\nAdditional resources:\nDocumentation portal 2\nDevelopers portal\ndeBridge explorer\ndeBridge team will be glad to facilitate the development and security audit of all smart contracts needed to relay and execute Uniswap governance decisions from Ethereum to BNB Chain. If deBridge is chosen as messaging provider, our team will cover costs for the security audit, performed by our long-term security partner Halborn\nWe welcome any questions about deBridge in the comments below",

        "replyFullContent": "Just wanted to quickly drop my thoughts on bridge providers for Uniswap v3 deployments.\nThis is a governance bridge, and the Uniswap treasury is held on L1, so the main risk is a malicious governance proposal pointing the fee switch to a malicious address. This would siphon off funds while L1 governance deploys a new proposal to turn off the fee switch and de activate compromised bridge.\nzk, optimistic, and light client “conanical” bridges are what we should be shooting for.\nEven then, I’m personally not fully convinced on Optimistic Fraud proofs but many in this community are. While I think while they aren’t ideal, this is an acceptable risk tolerance for the governance use case.\nNetwork of Validator bridges are glorified multisigs and should have a high level of scrutiny applied to them.\ncryptographic security >>> crypto-economic incentives\nI don’t think Network of Validator bridges are inherently unacceptable for Uniswap, but it’s important to realize they come in all shapes and sizes. It is important to ask a lot of questions such as:\n\nValidator set size, and more importantly, who is running these validators\nSigning threshold; does any small combination of entities running validators meet this threshold\nDoes required stake/slash make it significantly unprofitable to exploit bridge\n\nI mostly worry that many networks may have a single entity managing a large set of the validators, and a single phishing email could compromise a large set of the signing keys.\nUniswap is not ready to adopt a single bridge provider (and therefore, in my opinion not ready to expand its cross-chain ventures beyond governance), and therefore this risk is only relevant to the governance problem. The above scrutiny on network of validator bridges are not specific to any of the providers mentioned in this thread- just want to make sure community analyzes risk appropriately.",

        "replyFullContent": "Thank you for participating in our conversation and for your feedback on the bridge topic of this proposal.\nI believe the Uniswap community understands and evaluates the risks of cross-chain governance messaging using the current bridge infrastructure. As many chains, where Uniswap v3 will be deployed in 2023, don’t have a zk or optimistic bridges, we have to rely on other trusted providers of bridge infrastructure. That’s why I proposed a list of the potential bridges (deBridge, Celer, Stargate, Layer Zero) to proceed with the feather governance voting on a new chain.\nAlso, the bridge risk can only arise on subsequent votes regarding fees in the protocol, and potential financial risk can only be expressed in a maximum of a couple of hundred thousand dollars not earned by liquidity providers in a short period of time. Ultimately, this risk cannot affect the liquidity allocated in the protocol. And also this bridge risk is not affecting the initial protocol deployment for this proposal.\nThe initial Uniswap v3 protocol deployment to BNB chain (or to any other chain) will include all fee tiers (1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.01) so probably the governance won’t touch the protocol for the entire year or two. This period will be more than enough to explore the most trusted bridge infrastructure until the next on-chain proposal for Uniswap on BNB chain.\nLooking forward to further discussion.",

        "replyFullContent": "Exciting proposal for sure. Mo from Celer Network here. I would love to introduce Celer and also respond to the questions listed here.\n\nA quick introduction to Celer:\nCeler is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users.\n\nHow to build Uniswap’s cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models)\nCeler IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with FutureSwap 8 since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the application design pattern 1.\nWhen a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call sendMessage of a “send box” contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision.\nThis message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain.\nA message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call executeMessage of a “receive box” contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract.\nThe validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain.\nHowever, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the second security model: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a “quarantine zone” for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from “trust majority stake” to “trust any” with app developers capable of running one of the “any” App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module.\nOnce the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process.\nNext, we answer the questions raised in the post.\n\nDoes the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\nOf course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains.\n\nIs the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?\nThis is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description.\nAs discussed above, Celer’s generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celer’s security models:\nCeler comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis.\n\nCosmos-consensus Security Model\n\nBy default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELR’s value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions.\n\nOptimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model ( what should be used in this case )\n\n\n1600×706 130 KB\n\nSo, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario.\nInstead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be “committed” to the blockchain by SGN into a “quarantine zone” for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be “confirmed” and pushed to the final destination application.\nDuring this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celer’s construct will still maintain safety property without any concern.\n\nDoes the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?\nWhen operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the “trust-any” model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure.\n\nIs it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?\nWhen operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain.\nThis is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain.\n\nWhat are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?\nTheir CELR stake will be slashed.\n\nHas the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?\nCeler was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified.",

    "fullContent": "\nUniswap Foundation: Preamble\nUniswap has already changed the world.\nIn only 3 years, the world’s first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than $1T 15 in cumulative volume, and served millions of users 7 worldwide. Its daily volume today is on par with Coinbase 17.\nOwnership of the protocol was transferred to the community 33 in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP has funded 120+ grantees 47 improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling.\nHowever, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects.\nWe want to change that.\nToday, we are excited to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community.\nIn other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support you.\nUniswap’s community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more.\nThe Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future.\nIt will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem.\nIt will help you make an impact – to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts.\nWe believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet.\nIt brought the automated market maker to the masses.\nIt has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3.\nIt is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure – constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our world’s financial infrastructure.\nBut there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential.\nWe’re excited to work with all of you to make that happen.\nIf you’re excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - @devinawalsh 139 and @nkennethk 97 are open!), and spread the word.\n\nUniswap Foundation Proposal\nThis proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh 139 and Ken Ng 97 to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal.\n\nTL;DR\n\nToday, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation (UF).\n\nScope: The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocol’s decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate.\n\nTeam: Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12.\n\nBudget: To fund these efforts, we are requesting:\n\nA $14M Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years\nA $60M expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years\nWe are requesting $74M total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of $20M.\n\n\n\nGovernance Participation: We are also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive The Franchiser 67, this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance.\n\n\nUniswap Foundation\n\nMission\nIn pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem.\n\nKey Activities and OKRs\nWe have listed our starting OKRs below. It’s possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community.\nGrowth: Promoting Decentralization & Growth of the Protocol and Ecosystem\n\nOKR 11298×840 94.6 KB\n\nGovernance: Reinvigorating the Uniswap Community Governance Process\n\nOKR 21282×342 36.5 KB\n\nAdvocacy: Advocating for the Protocol and amplifying its positive social impact\n\nOKR 31306×328 52.9 KB\n\nOptimism Phase 0 token distribution link here 19\n\nYear 1 Roadmap\nOur roadmap for the first year of operations includes but is not limited to the following activities:\n\nYear 1646×825 252 KB\n\nOptimism Collective community Constitution link here 5\n\nTeam\nDevin Walsh 139, Executive Director (ED)\nAs ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UF’s strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision.\nDevin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative 5, worked on decentralized identity at uPort (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at CoinFund. She has consulted with Edge & Node and cLabs 3, and led MIRA 6, a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF.\nKen Ng 97, Head of Operations\nAs Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UF’s impact.\nKen has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the Uniswap Grants Program 7 for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support Program 3, which gave Hayden his initial grant 7 to build Uniswap. He served as COO of Slingshot Finance 7 and cofounder of his nonprofit eduDAO 9, which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx.\nThe needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first:\n\nApplications are open today! Check out job descriptions here 79.\nAs noted by Other Internet 8, there is also a need for new structures to “facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders” within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives.\n\nAdvisors\nThe Foundation’s initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals:\n\n\nJesse Walden 14, Founder and GP, Variant 2\n\n\nJulia Rosenberg 16, Co-Founder, Orca Protocol 14\n\n\nAlexis Gauba 40, Co-Founder, Opyn 4; Co-Founder, she256 8\n\n\nHart Lambur 14, Co-Founder of UMA 5\n\n\nIn addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations,\n\nProvide input on UF’s initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members.\nBecome temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired.\n\n\nBoard\nDevin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UF’s Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations.\n\nBudget\nWe are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets:\n\n$60M for Uniswap Grants Program\n\nGrants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful.\nWe are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this retrospective 47), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work.\n\nWe are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are:\n\nA version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet\nA prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space\n\nWe are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons.\nTo ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M.\nWe believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining.\n\n\n$14M operating budget to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years.\n\nIn order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below).\nBudget estimate looking forward three years is below.\n\n*Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year.\n**The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation.\n\nFund Disbursements\nAn approval of this proposal is an approval for the full $74M budget requested.\nWe are requesting the funds in two disbursements:\n\n\n$20M now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $7.04*, this initial request totals to 2,840,909 UNI.\n\n\n$54M, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement.\n\n*To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $7.04 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/3/2022.\n\nGovernance Participation\nThe UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance.\nThese tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, The Franchiser 67, which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals.\nThe Franchiser was developed by Noah Zinsmeister 7 and was audited by Trail of Bits 1.\n\nNext Steps\nWe are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check.\nAdditionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Mon., August 15.\n\nAddendum\n\nWhat is UF’s relationship with other ecosystem entities?\nThe goal of the UF is to be one of many organizations supporting the Protocol. UF’s overarching focus will be on seeding and growing an ecosystem of entities supporting the Protocol.\n\nWhat is UF’s relationship with Uniswap Labs?\nThe UF is an independent entity whose mandate will be to grow Uniswap’s usage, reinvigorate the governance process, and advocate for the protocol and community. To achieve those goals, it will build its own lean team, and provide grants to, support, and/or work alongside a number of existing and new values- and mission-aligned organizations.\nUniswap Labs is one of many organizations in the Uniswap ecosystem. It built, deployed, and, alongside many other teams, will continue to contribute to and build on the Protocol in the future.\nAs a commitment to the proper decentralization of the protocol, Uniswap Labs had previously provided a royalty free perpetual license for V3 and related trademarks to the Uniswap Grants Program and selected grantees at UGP’s discretion. To succeed, the UF will require the ability to grant v3 BSL license exemptions, to maintain the governance forum, Sybil.org 8, and Protocol-related developer docs, and to help facilitate protocol development across many teams. Labs has given their blessing to this preliminary proposal for asset transition.\n\nWhat kind of legal entity will UF be?\nCurrently, this proposal is being made by the Uniswap Foundation, a pre-existing Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng. However, the UF team is conducting extensive research to determine the type of legal entity which best matches our ambitions, including our mission to make a positive social impact. The entity should also give the UF the ability to enter into contracts, open a bank account, and hire employees. Given these requirements, we are contemplating a US-based entity that would seek tax-exempt status. As there is no guarantee that tax-exempt status will be secured, we may make modifications to UF’s structure and operations in the future. We will share more about our path forward with the community as soon as we are able to.\n\nWhat will happen to the $UNI after it’s sent to the UF?\nIf the proposal passes, funds will be sent to the UF multi-sig, which is custodied by the ED, Head of Operations, and UF Advisors.\nTo provide runway for our team and grantees, we intend to convert all $20M of the initial UNI disbursement to stablecoins and fiat over the first month of operation. We have established relationships with multiple brokers, are also exploring private sale options, and plan to pursue an approach which will minimize UNI price impact.\nWe similarly plan to diversify the remainder of funds in the second disbursement. At least one month prior to transfer, the UF will publish a Foundation Treasury Diversification report for this UNI. In the report, we will detail the amount we plan to diversify, which broker we plan to use, and how we plan to price the UNI sold.\n\nHow does UF’s Budget compare with the budgets of similar organizations across web3?\nThe $74M budget represents ~1.05% of the total UNI supply. This is a relatively small percentage of UNI supply compared to the percentage of tokens allocated to Foundation and Grant programs by other protocol teams.\n\n45% of OP tokens have been allocated to an Optimism Ecosystem Fund (25%) and Retroactive public goods funding (20%) (here 4)\nAn unpublished portion of ~22% of dYdX were allocated to current and future employees and consultants of the Foundation (here 7)\n~26% of GRT was allocated to The Graph Foundation, educational programs, and grants (here 3)\n25% of CELO was allocated to Community and Operational Grants (here 5)\n12.5% of SOL was allocated to the Solana Foundation (here 2)\nThe Ethereum Foundation holds a treasury of $1.6B (here 3)\n\n\nWhat happens to UGP and the UGP Subcommittees?\nTo start, UGP will continue operations as it exists today with the existing Allocation Committee. Once the Grants Lead is hired, they will lead all grants funding decisions and require final approval from either Devin or Ken (⅔ approval required from Grants Lead, Ken, and Devin).\nUF plans to continue to fund the existing UGP subcommittees as separate, supportive entities. The Stable 4 subcommittee will continue to be made up of Ken and Boris 2. The UGP Community Analytics subcommittees will continue to be made up of Yj 2, Fede 1, RantumBits 2, Annamira 3, TZM, and Trea Qura 1.\n\nHow does the UF plan on being sustainable over time?\nThis proposal would fund UF operations for at least 3 years. In the future, we plan to return to the community to increase our operating budget when we approach 18 months of runway.\nWe also predict our grants budget will last approximately 3 years. In the future, we plan to return to the community to increase our grants budget when we approach 6 months of funds remaining.\nIf this proposal is passed, we and the Foundation shall undertake our work abiding by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\nIt is the Foundation’s current intent to use the disbursement in accordance with the terms of, and achieve the results described in, this Proposal. However, it is not possible to predict the course of future events, and thus actual uses and results may vary. If material changes to the operations of the Uniswap Foundation are required, we intend to put forth a subsequent vote to the community prior to making those changes.\nSubject to any future agreement by the DAO to the contrary, the Foundation will hold the DAO and its members harmless with respect to any liabilities or damages assessed against the Foundation or its personnel based upon the making of the disbursement, the Foundation’s or its personnel’s use of the disbursed tokens or any other activities undertaken by the Foundation or its personnel in furtherance of the foregoing, other than liabilities or damages arising out of the DAO’s fraud, willful misconduct or criminal activity.\nDisclosure: Devin and Ken both hold UNI tokens. To the extent that readers find it relevant, Devin also holds a small amount of Uniswap Labs equity.1 Reply19",

That issue is the lack of a clear center of authority and source of legitimacy.\nThe outcomes such a party’s absence include:\n\nhigh levels of politicking needed to get anything done\nvoter apathy and delegate fatigue\nslow operational decentralization\nlack of accountability in partnerships (more on this in our forthcoming paper)\ndifficulty in improving the governance process\n\nWe are supportive of the proposed foundation because we believe it will address these problems, not only through various initiatives, but also by simply being an actor with the mandate to be a channel for various stakeholders to connect and get things done. That there are dev relations, delegate relations, and partnership leads roles listed (with job postings already!) is a hugely positive sign for the type of operational capacity and speed that the foundation should unlock for Uniswap governance.\nAs a side note, I hope this proposal makes clear what I’ve been advocating for in the fee switch conversation. There are a lot of things that need to happen for Uniswap protocol to continue to grow; with or without protocol revenue, the Foundation is the best bet to make those things happen.\nTL;DR - Uniswap Foundation is an entity that can represent the interests of the protocol and its various stakeholders. It can scope projects, be a legal counterparty, liaise with delegates and get things done.

    "fullContent": "\nSummary\nThis proposal will grant a Uniswap v3 BSL exemption to the Nethermind 18 team to deploy Uniswap v3 onto StarkNet mainnet 19.\n\nStarkNet is a permissionless ZK-rollup that inherits security from Ethereum mainnet. StarkNet runs CairoVM, a virtual machine optimized for generating zero-knowledge proofs about L2 state transitions. Cairo is the high-level language used for writing smart contracts on StarkNet.\nWarp is a transpiler from Solidity to Cairo developed by a team at Nethermind. Nethermind has successfully used Warp to transpile the Uniswap v3 Core contracts to Cairo. Uniswap v3 Core is currently running on a local StarkNet testnet, passing all provided tests. The Nethermind team may use Warp to transpile the Uniswap v3 codebase and deploy it on StarkNet.\n\n\nAbout StarkNet\nStarkNet is a permissionless, general-purpose Zk-rollup developed by StarkWare 1. StarkNet uses STARKs 7 to securely generate and succinctly verify proofs about state transitions on the L2 and use those proofs to update the state root on Ethereum Mainnet securely. STARKs enable StarkNet state to be secured by Ethereum Mainnet consensus in a cheap and scalable way.\nStarkNet runs ZK-compatible virtual machine CairoVM, allowing applications on StarkNet high levels of computational scalability. Cairo, the high-level language native to the CairoVM, directly compiles into opcodes that can efficiently be evaluated in a ZK-circuit to generate succinct validity proofs about state changes.\n\nEcosystem\nStarkNet’s unique approach to L2 scaling has unlocked an impressive level of computational scalability, and several novel features not native to the EVM. One of the most notable features is that StarkNet has native account abstraction(AA), meaning there is no distinction between EOAs and account contracts. There are several wallets and tools that utilize AA on StarkNet; AA has been praised as an essential feature in achieving mass adoption. The unique tooling and scalability enabled by StarkNet make it highly qualified for a Uniswap v3 deployment.\nThere are 100+ projects currently being built on StarkNet, natively in Cairo. Here is a non-exhaustive list of projects 18 building on StarkNet.\n\nAbout Warp\nWarp is a Solidity to Cairo transpiler developed by Nethermind. While developer tooling around Cairo, StarkNet’s native language, is rapidly growing, it is not yet up to par with the thriving ecosystem that encapsulates Solidity. Warp’s goal is to enable developers to leverage StarkNet’s computational scalability, unique features, and vast tooling for Solidity development. Warp is an efficient transpiler that can port over large codebases written in Solidity to Cairo to run on StarkNet. Warp passes all relevant semantic tests 3 provided by the Solidity compiler.\nThe Warp team has already transpiled the Solidity codebase of Uniswap v3 Core to Cairo. The transpiled contracts are running on a local StarkNet testnet, passing all provided tests. While this is a massive achievement for the Warp project, we expect to achieve far greater computational scalability through refinements to Warp and upcoming upgrades to StarkNet.\n\nTimeline\nIf passed, the community can expect to have Uniswap v3 fully deployed and supported on StarkNet mainnet by Q2 2023. The Nethermind team could be ready to deploy a transpiled and tested version of Uniswap v3 Core in Cairo on StarkNet mainnet today. While this deployment is entirely viable, some key optimizations are coming that will allow a StarkNet Uniswap v3 deployment to best enjoy the benefits of the StarkNet Ecosystem. Here is an outline of our current timeline and the reasoning behind it.\n\n\nWill deploy our current version of v3-core in cairo on StarkNet public testnet in the coming weeks to allow community testing while we continue work simultaneously to improve the efficiency of Warp and UniStark.\n\n\nWill deploy on mainnet after StarkNet regenesis 14 (Q1 2023)\n\nforced transactions from L1. L1 contracts can call L2 contracts without the possibility of censorship. I.e., censorship-resistant guarantees for cross-chain governance proposals\ngas metering: more dynamic fee market on StarkNet.\n\n\n\nTranspilation, optimization, and testing of non-core contracts are underway.\n\nWe’ve proven core 2 functionality of Uniswap v3; we are currently working on all additional contracts that will support the v3 deployment, such as periphery 1\n\n\n\n\nWarp’s efficiency is still improving every day. Some key optimizations can be made to the transpiled Uniswap core contracts to better leverage the computational efficiency provided by Cairo and further reduce gas costs. Currently, Warp is working on being completely compatible with Cairo 1 2.\n\n\nCairo 1 2 has native support for basic constructs like loops and if-else statements without unnecessary variable copying. Once Warp targets Cairo 1, it can leverage the efficient native implementation of these features. Additionally, Cairo 1 adds support for recoverable errors used by the periphery 1 contracts.\n\n\nDevelopment of an interface\n\nStarkNet and CarioVM introduce unique tooling, such as Argent 1 and Braavos 1 Account Abstraction wallets.\nNethermind is developing a usable Uniswap v3 interface for our StarkNet deployment to ensure users can easily interact with these contracts on day one as the official front end is being integrated.\n\n\n\nAdditional efforts to bring over Uniswap v3 liquidity managers, liquidity providers, and other critical infrastructure that will help the Uniswap v3 deployment on StarkNet thrive.\n\n\nAs Warp continues to improve, Nethermind will consider the benefits of a native Cairo rewrite of specific Uniswap v3 contracts.\n\n\n\nProposal\nStarkNet offers high computational scalability and unique design decisions, strictly secured by Ethereum consensus. With the advent of Warp, this proposal offers an easy and ethical route for Uniswap to leverage the StarkNet ecosystem and tooling. StarkNet is Ethereum aligned and believes the goals of our ecosystem align with that of Uniswap.\nBenefits to Uniswap:\n\nDeploy Uniswap on a zk-rollup with a thriving and growing ecosystem.\nReduced gas costs on Uniswap transactions.\nExpand beyond the EVM while still maintaining Ethereum alignment.\nInteroperability with a plethora of novel tooling being built on StarkNet.\nPotential v3 applications enabled by StarkNet’s computational scalability, such as advanced oracle support, etc.\nAccess to native account abstraction\n\n\nStarkNet Security & Bridges\nZk-rollups have been recognized as the gold standard for Ethereum scaling solutions. This recognition comes from the strong security guarantees of zk-validity proofs about L2 state transitions. Because of the strong cryptographic guarantees around zero-knowledge proof generation and verification, we can be sure the sequencer cannot propose invalid L2 state transitions. StarkNet allows for secure native general message passing between L1<>L2- leveraging validity proofs such that the sequencer, the actor responsible for L1<>L2 message passing, cannot lie about the state or create false messages from the origin chain. The only malicious activity possible is that the sequencer can stop sending messages, freezing L1<>L2 communication. After StarkNet regenesis, users can force L2 transactions from L1 without consent from the sequencer. The sequencer is currently run and maintained by Starkware but there is a plan to decentralize the sequencer role in 2023.\n\nRFC on Uniswap’s non-EVM-native Deployment Procedure\nAs a contender for the first non-EVM-native deployment of Uniswap, we want to help define the alternative-VM deployment strategy of the Uniswap DAO through our proposal.\nExecuting code on its non-native VM introduces risks that aren’t present in native execution; there must be some translation between the original Uniswap v3 EVM bytecode and the bytecode of the VM being executed on. The translation can take place at different layers of abstraction: at a high level via transpiler or manual rewrite (see Warp; AAVE v3 Cairo aToken bridge 8); or at a bytecode level, like non-bytecode equivalent zkEVMs (see type 3/4 zkEVMs on Vitalik.ca).\nThis additional risk should be accounted for through additional audits, bug bounty programs, beta periods of limited liquidity, or other means. We are asking the Uniswap community to use this proposal to analyze and define the risk tolerance and best practices around non-EVM-native deployments. The team at Nethermind is committed to being transparent about the risks associated with expanding Uniswap to non-EVM-native environments and defining appropriate measures alongside the Uniswap community.\nWe hope to deploy Uniswap v3 on StarkNet and help the community set precedence for future non-EVM-native deployments of the codebase.\n\nLicense Exemption\nThis proposal will grant Demerzel Solutions Limited, the legal entity behind Nethermind, an exemption from Uniswap Labs Business Source Licence for the Uniswap v3 source code. Provided that this proposal is passed pursuant to the Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control process, Demerzel Solutions shall be able to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on StarkNet Mainnet, a layer 2 solution for Ethereum.21",

Before properly answering this question it becomes really important to understand the risk tolerance of the community concerning development of Uniswap for other VMs.\n\nWould the DAO be willing to fund (or jointly fund) a bug bounty program, or additional pro-security programs concerning this deployment? It’s important to understand beforehand what the community believes is conditional for alternative-VM deployments as it will greatly impact the overall cost.\n\nAs mentioned in the proposal, Nethermind is prepared to deploy Uniswap v3-core on StarkNet using Warp today. While this deployment is completely viable, it is clear to us that additional resources would greatly boost the performance and associated tooling with a StarkNet deployment of Uniswap (Building fuzz testing for warp contracts; Warping over liquidity managers built on top of v3; improving efficiency; exploring native Cairo re-write of specific contracts and following audits; building a frontend supportive of StarkNet Account Abstraction wallets).\nIt’s also important to note that Nethermind is not StarkWare (the founding company behind StarkNet) or the StarkNet Foundation (the foundation which oversees the layer 2’s development and decentralization). All current development on “UniStark” (our internal name for this project) is through grants we have received to develop the Warp tooling itself, not grants specifically for this Uniswap deployment. We are happy to continue through with a proper funding proposal once we have clarity on\n\n\nWould responsibility for funding this work fall on the Uniswap Foundation, Uniswap Community, or even Uniswap Labs?\n\n\nIs there any precedence for this that we are missing?\n\n\nDoes the community feel comfortable with a bug bounty program and capped liquidity period or are there additional costs we must consider to meet the Uniswap communities standards\n\n\nIf the community does not have strong opinions about point 3. We can draft an updated funding proposal on our own with expected cost of audits and required security features; though we wanted to have this conversation in the open, as it is likely to become precedence for future non-EVM-native deployments of Uniswap code.\nI think the only strong requirement before the community grants Nethermind a license to deploy is defining any contingencies unique to the security of alternative-VM deployments. This way Nethermind can be assured the community feels comfortable with the security of our deployment and can work separately to source funding to meet these requirements.",

The deployment covered in this proposal will have a liquidity cap to reduce risk.\n\n\nI’m somewhat confused by the conversation of liability. This proposal (as stated by following comments) will be to deploy Uniswap v3 contracts with a capped liquidity of $30k (tentative number the community must agree upon). Is “Uniswap” current liable for loss of liquidity on other uncapped deployments? i.e. a bug exploited in v3 on mainnet, ZK-Sync’s bytecode interpreter introduces a bug, Optimisms proof system fails and funds are lost. I’m not saying these are likely, but I’d like to understand where liability falls in these scenarios- and what’s legally actionable. I don’t believe the BSL exemption implies anything about liability? If Uniswap has taken liability for all current deployments how does this change when license expires? From my untrained legal perspective, possibly Uniswap Labs assumes some liability when listing on their front-end (which this proposal does not cover).\n\nSeems like a solvency fund would reduce concern- but I’m starting to wonder if this is necessary given a primary testnet deployment, max loss capped at $30k on mainnet, and a Nethermind hosted frontend with proper disclaimers about risk.\n\n\n\nThe existing bug bounty program by Labs will not encompass this deployment; I was mentioning we would like to explore opening a separate joint bug bounty program (not encompassed in this limited liquidity deployment proposal)\n\n",

        "replyFullContent": "Hi Deven,\nThis is a great proposal.\nWarp is a cutting edge technology that is vital for scaling Ethereum.  Today’s zero knowledge virtual machines are highly optimized for prover time and efficiency.  While these optimizations are vital, they often come at the expense of strict EVM compatibility.   Transpilers such as Warp are the bridge between high-level EVM compatible languages like Solidity and zk-VM optimized languages like Cairo.\nThis project is extremely important for Starknet, Uniswap, and the Ethereum community as a whole.  This isn’t just a routine Uniswap deployment.   This is a cutting edge experiment that will have huge implications for the entire ecosystem -  especially for our understanding of how complex EVM based systems operate in other environments.\nHere are a few considerations that I think will be vital to success:\n1.) UI/Frontend -  The v3 frontend is a large and complex codebase.  Most of the code is built on Web3 React.  The Starknet JS ecosystem is robust - but the code will require a lot of work before it reaches 1:1 parity.   What is the plan here?\n2.) Account Abstraction - This will be vital for on-boarding the next billion users.  Starknet already has account abstraction.  It would be a huge missed opportunity if we don’t fully explore account abstraction for this Uniswap deployment.\n3.) Coordination - Crypto is all about building together and not in isolation.  For this project to reach its full potential, there will be many moving parts and lots of complex technologies overlapping.  We should think seriously about creating some public/community structures to coordinate across multiple experts, involve relevant teams, and ensure this deployment reaches its full potential.\nHuge kudos to the Nethermind team for bringing this proposal forward.

    "fullContent": "\nMaking Protocol Fees Operational\n\n\nSummary\nWe propose implementing a protocol fee equal to ⅕ of the pool fee across all* Uniswap v3 pools and turning on the fee switch for Uniswap v2. The scope of this proposal is to implement a fee for Uniswap pools, implement a system to claim earned fees, and trustlessly sell the fees earned for an asset designated by the UNI community. In a subsequent proposal, the UNI community can decide how to manage, allocate, distribute, or otherwise utilize the assets accrued to the treasury.\nWith the community’s support, the Uniswap v3 Polygon deployment will be the initial deployment to implement the system. After a successful implementation, a subsequent proposal will be made for the Ethereum deployment, and others as deemed necessary by governance.\n*All pools with regular volumes that would generate an annualized income over $10,000 for the protocol.\n\nCurrent Deployments Overview\nUniswap v2 and v3 are Uniswap’s primary protocols. Uniswap v3 Ethereum has about $2.4b in total value locked (TVL) and has daily volumes between $11b-$400m. Uniswap v2 has about $1.1b in TVL and averages approximately $75m in daily volume.\nOther Uniswap v3 Deployments*:\n\nPolygon: $128m TVL – $45m 24hr Volume\nOptimism: $80m TVL – $21m 24hr Volume\nArbitrum: $1.7b TVL – $244m 24hr Volume\nCelo: $9m TVL – $0.2m Volume\nBSC Chain: $10m TVL – $10m 24hr Volume\n\n*May 9th, 2023 - Calculating TVL and volume on a DEX is particularly difficult due to the number of tokens. These statistics may need to be more accurate but should paint a sufficient picture. Resources: https://info.uniswap.org/ 11 https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap 7\n\nWhy Turn On Fees?\nUniswap is in a strong position to turn on protocol fees and prove that the protocol can generate significant revenues. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, and market participants are used to paying fees to utilize exchanges. We need to reaffirm that liquidity providers are protocol users and do not need full rebates. The LPs making the most money off Uniswap are not retail traders. They are professional market makers, just like the ones seen on traditional exchanges. Trading on Uniswap is similar to trading on a traditional exchange except for the speed at which things occur.\nBelow is a comparison of what Uniswap charges users and what popular exchanges charge their users.\n\n\n\n\nBinance Fees\nMaker\nTaker\n\n\n\n\n< 1,000,000\n0.10%\n0.10%\n\n\n> 1,000,000\n0.09%\n0.10%\n\n\n> 5,000,000\n0.08%\n0.10%\n\n\n> 20,000,000\n0.07%\n0.10%\n\n\n> 100,000,000\n0.07%\n0.09%\n\n\n> 150,000,000\n0.06%\n0.08%\n\n\n> 400,000,000\n0.05%\n0.07%\n\n\n> 800,000,000\n0.04%\n0.06%\n\n\n> 2,000,000,000\n0.03%\n0.05%\n\n\n> 4,000,000,000\n0.02%\n0.04%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoinbase Advanced Fees\nMaker\nTaker\n\n\n< 10,000\n0.60%\n0.40%\n\n\n< 50,000\n0.40%\n0.25%\n\n\n< 100,000\n0.25%\n0.15%\n\n\n< 1,000,000\n0.20%\n0.10%\n\n\n< 15,000,000\n0.18%\n0.08%\n\n\n< 75,000,000\n0.16%\n0.06%\n\n\n< 250,000,000\n0.12%\n0.03%\n\n\n> 400,000,000\n0.08%\n0.00%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniswap v3\nMaker\nTaker\n\n\n> 0 - 0.01% Pool\n-0.01%\n0.01%\n\n\n> 0 - 0.05% Pool\n-0.05%\n0.05%\n\n\n> 0 - 0.30% Pool\n-0.30%\n0.30%\n\n\n> 0 - 1.00% Pool\n-1.00%\n1.00%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniswap v3 with 1/5 fee\nMaker\nTaker\n\n\n> 0 - 0.01% Pool\n-0.008%\n0.01%\n\n\n> 0 - 0.05% Pool\n-0.040%\n0.05%\n\n\n> 0 - 0.30% Pool\n-0.240%\n0.30%\n\n\n> 0 - 1.00% Pool\n-0.800%\n1.00%\n\n\n\nBinance 4\nCoinbase 1\nKraken 2\nUniswap is the only major exchange that pays Makers (in DeFi lingo - Liquidity Providers).\n\nFee Switch Protocol Income\n\n\n\n\nProtocol Fee\n6-month Protocol Fee Revenue\n\n\n\n\n1/4\n$65,183,978\n\n\n1/5\n$52,147,182\n\n\n1/6\n$43,455,985\n\n\n1/7\n$37,247,987\n\n\n1/8\n$32,591,989\n\n\n1/9\n$28,970,657\n\n\n1/10\n$26,073,591\n\n\n\nWe gathered protocol volume data for each pool and deployment since their inception. The table above is the hypothetical fee revenue the protocol would have generated over the last 6 months (taken from May 7th) if Uniswap had the protocol fee in the left column across all Uniswap v3 deployments. Of course, this snapshot is not entirely accurate because it doesn’t account for the effect of the fee tier enabled and various other factors. That said, our industry is volatile; protocol volumes can boom and bust regardless of the protocol fee.\n\n\n\n\nAll Deployments\nLifetime Protocol Fees (⅕)\n6-month Protocol Fees (⅕)\n\n\n\n\nEthereum\n$281,655,289\n$39,612,161\n\n\nPolygon\n$6,522,706\n$2,446,838\n\n\nArbitrum\n$13,720,260\n$8,279,880\n\n\nOptimism\n$3,983,873\n$1,697,055\n\n\nBSC\n$102,061\n$102,061\n\n\nCelo\n$14,715\n$9,188\n\n\nTotal\n$305,998,902\n$52,147,182\n\n\n\n\nUniswap v2\nThe term “fee switch” was popularized because Uniswap v2 has a single variable that dictates whether the protocol takes a fee. The Uniswap v2 factory contract has a variable feeTo, currently assigned to the 0x0000… address. Each Uniswap pool checks to see if this address is set to something, and if so, then fees will accrue to the address.\nAll Uniswap v2 pools have a 30 bps swap/taker fee. Presently, the 30 bps is fully paid to the liquidity providers (LP) in the pool. Once the fee switch is enabled, 5 bps will be saved as an LP share in the pool, and the remaining 25 bps will go to the LPs.\nThe Uniswap v2 factory 3 contract has a function setFeeTo(address) which the FeeToSette 1r can call. The FeeToSetter is another smart contract owned by the Uniswap Timelock contract. Governance can turn on fees by calling the toggleFees(bool) function. As currently configured, fees will accrue to the FeeTo 4 contract.\nThe FeeTo contract is owned by governance, but its ownership can be transferred to another destination. It is this contract that can claim fees from the Uniswap v2 pools.\nv2 fees accrue when a mint/burn function occurs. The mint/burn function checks to see if the pool’s K (product) has improved since the last liquidity event. A trade must have occurred if the K has increased, and the pool will mint a UNI-LP token to the FeeTo address. The FeeTo address can redeem the LP token for the underlying components.\n\nUniswap v3\nNow that the process for collecting fees on Uniswap v2 is understood, let’s turn to v3.\nv3 sets fees on a pool-by-pool basis, with a fee of 0 as the default. This default value cannot be changed. This means each new pool would need to have fees introduced individually. Note that v3 limits one pool per pair and fee tier so that no one can make additional pools for a pair and fee tier. Each pool has a setFeeProtocol function that the factory owner controls. The fee may be set to 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. This is interpreted as one over the set number. For example, a 30bps fee tier pool with a parameter of 10 would be a 10% protocol fee and thus would be 3bps to the protocol and 27bps to LPs.\nBecause v3 pools require individual fee activation, only activating fees on pools with sufficient volume will help governance avoid constantly voting to turn on fees every time a new pool is deployed. We recommend activating fees only on pools expected to generate at least $10,000 in annualized income for the protocol.\n\nFee Claiming\nOnce the fee is set, the protocol fees will begin to accrue. To claim fees, the factory owner can call the collectProtocol  3function(address, amount, amount).\nDue to the factory owner being the timelock contract, the protocol must initiate a governance proposal to adjust fee parameters and claim the protocol’s accrued fees. Not only would this be an inefficient process for the protocol to upkeep, but it would also likely run into the block’s gas limit if it were to try to claim for all pools. However, the owner of the factory contract could be changed to a new contract that can sit between the timelock and the factory. This new contract could have a separate, more appropriately equipped system for managing the claiming of fees.\n\nFee Management\nAs fees accrue, the protocol should claim and sell the tokens to minimize the protocol’s long exposure to the assets it is earning. The system must sell the protocol assets without relying on any person or entity. Assets must be sold through a transparent, trustless, and open system while functioning objectively.\nWe propose a solution that allows anyone to pay the gas to collect the fees, sell the fee tokens automatically via the Uniswap auto-router, and then send the proceeds to the protocol treasury. This effectively means the protocol has a resting offer to sell its accrued fees. MEV bots and other parties can wait until the resting order opens an arbitrage opportunity; once profitable to execute, anyone can execute the order.\n\nDevelopment Process\nWhile the Uniswap v3 protocol is non-upgradable, the community should view these proposed changes as requiring a new module to be added to the core protocol. Since the protocol is non-upgradable, the protocol needs to implement new contracts to manage the additional actions. First, a new ownership setup of the Uniswap v3 factory contract to empower the DAO to manage protocol fee-related actions effectively. Second, a contract that handles the claiming of protocol earned fees, selling them for the protocol’s designated treasury asset, and transferring the assets to the protocol’s treasury.\nThe protocol needs to be able to effectively carry out the following actions for a large number of pools:\n\nSetting the pool’s fee\nCollecting the pool’s protocol-earned fees\nSelling the pool’s protocol-earned fees\n\nAs it currently stands, the DAO would need to make a new governance proposal each time any one of these actions would need to be taken. Due to onchain votes taking 10 days and having a maximum number of 10 actions per proposal means, the DAO has to pursue an alternative solution – a separate system/governance for protocol fee-related operations.\nThe first option is to change the existing governance contract to allow more than 10 actions; however, this solution would mean regular governance proposals to claim fees, likely leading to poor management of the fees accrued in pools.\nThe second option is to change the governance structure to make proposals easier to pass; however, the governance system controls the $2b Uniswap treasury, so we shouldn’t do anything to jeopardize the treasury’s security.\nThe third option, our preferred route, separates the actions related to protocol fee management from the rest of the system. By implementing a new owner on the Uniswap v3 factory contract, we can better define access to the key functions required for protocol fee management. For example, the setFeeProtocol function could require the same quorum that the current governance system has but can be called well over 10 times in a proposal. In addition, we could allow anyone to call the function collectProtocol function but predefine the function’s allowed parameters, like the recipient parameter being the fee-selling contract.\n\nTax & Legal Concerns\nFor as long as the fee switch has been debated, people have been concerned with the legal and tax ramifications of activating it. We’ve had numerous conversations with Uniswap delegates, key stakeholders, and DeFi participants at large to understand the scope and depth of the concerns. Through our conversations, we’ve found that the primary concern is around the distribution/use of the earned fees and the possible tax implications of collecting fees. GFX Labs is not equipped to provide, and is not giving the protocol or those reading this post, advice on the best course of action concerning this proposal’s legal and tax concerns. We have separated the protocol fee discussion into two distinct conversations. One is the technical implementation of accruing fees in pools, collecting the accrued fees, and selling the accrued assets to a protocol-designated asset to be held in the treasury, and a separate conversation of how the assets in the treasury could be distributed, spent, or otherwise utilized.\nFor voters concerned about the possible tax consequences of collecting a protocol fee, note that the protocol has the treasury to answer any necessary call for paying taxes until the protocol utilizes the treasury. At which point, the protocol will decide on how the treasury should be managed. For the purposes of this proposal, treasury management is out of scope.\n\nNext Steps\nThis proposal introduces a possible structure for implementing protocol fees. Before we get into the smart contract development and implementation details, we would like to solicit UNI voters’ feedback on the proposal.\n\nKey Questions For Voters\n\nDo you agree Uniswap does not need to offer substantial fee rebates to liquidity providers?\nDo you agree a one-fifth fee tier is the appropriate starting point for a protocol fee?\nDo you agree a new system for fee management is a good approach to carrying out the necessary maintenance surrounding the fee switch?\nDo you agree implementing the system on Polygon is a good first step?\nWhat token do you think the DAO should trade fee income for to be held in the protocol treasury?\n\nWe’ll let everyone process the above post for at least two weeks before putting up a temperature check.

Yeah, it’s clearly technically feasible, and your implementation makes sense - but that doesn’t mean we should go forward with development just because we can.\nHere’s a quick overview of the benefits of turning on the fee switch:\n\nUniswap DAO accumulates a larger treasury (they already have the second largest one, I suppose we could go for gold)\nI suppose the token price probably goes up a bit\n\nHere’s my take on the downsides:\n\nThe DAO has shown it’s quite bad at allocating funds efficiently - not that it’s the DAO’s fault. DAOs are just really difficult to operate as businesses (look at how complicated Maker has become to attempt to do so). So I’m not even sure we could use the money effectively, even if we wanted to.\nWe’d be wasting a massive token price catalyst in the middle of a bear market.\nV3’s business license just expired. Turning on a fee switch and making it easier for forks to compete seems like a very bad idea. If the fee switch was turned on I’d bet the number of serious V3 forks doubles in a month. Why invite more competition without a very good reason?\nThe legal and tax risks of turning on the fee switch are massive - and I don’t think it’s fair to skate over them in this proposal. The current administration is extremely crypto-hostile, Uniswap Labs is US-based, and rumor has it that Labs is/was being investigated by the SEC already. Why would we give the feds even more reason to come after Uniswap by making the token look more like a security?\n\nIf we want to move towards turning on the fee switch, I think a much better idea would be selling a portion of the UNI in the treasury. If it turns out the DAO can effectively allocate those funds and handle the legal and tax ramifications of the sale - then let’s start thinking about turning on the switch.",

These points have to be solved first, and only after that we shall discuss how the fee switch should be set (personally I would start with 1/10 instead of 1/5).

        "replyFullContent": "Buy-back of UNI should be the default case for the treasury. I see no value in turning on the fee-switch to grow the treasury pot without using incoming funds for anything other than strengthening the treasury and extending the operational runway for the DAO. Maybe an additional % is burned to provide some positive price pressure on the UNI token itself.\nActual implementation of doing that is another thing entirely however.\nAs for the fears about SEC and hostile crypto regulation: quite frankly, not my problem. Im not a US resident, and I dont care what the SEC thinks of UNI. If crypto and DAO structures are supposed to be as decentralized and resilient against state intervention as we all keep saying it is, then we meet regulation head on.\nAs for UniLabs, an SEC investigation if the community turns on the fee-switch is a UniLabs problem. Not the DAOs. We can of course (and should) vote to use treasury funds to support Unilabs in the event of such litigation.",

        "replyFullContent": "\nUniswap Fee Switch Q/A - part: 1\n\nThe protocol already has a large treasury; what is the point of generating income?\n\nIt’s a misconception that the protocol has a large treasury when ~100% of the treasury is UNI tokens. Each additional UNI spent from the treasury diminishes the value of the existing UNI due to increasing the circulating supply. Uncirculated UNI may as well not exist, and its use is akin to minting more UNI tokens; they are equivalent.\nRather than fund initiatives such as the Defi Education Fund, the Uniswap Foundation, the Protocol Guild, and others by increasing the circulating supply of UNI, the protocol could use the fee income to support these initiatives and new ones. Ultimately, it is entirely up to the DAO to allocate these resources. However, we can’t debate treasury allocation when the protocol doesn’t have income to allocate.\nRelevant to this discussion, the DAO will likely see a request from the Uniswap Foundation for ~$40m in the not-distant future. While the Uniswap Foundation was initially funded with $20m, their full request was closer to $60m.\n\nWhy won’t LPs leave?\n\nLPs have free will. They can choose which protocol to deploy capital to, and at Uniswap, they can choose between 4 different fee tiers to participate in. If they think they can make more money elsewhere, they can go elsewhere. However, they must remember who is paying them. It isn’t the protocol paying them; it is the folks swapping through the protocol. More specifically, people on the Uniswap frontend swapping, which only drives volume to the underlying protocol. As of May 1st, 80% of the volume on Uniswap Ethereum was done directly with the protocol rather than using an aggregator.\n\n1838×742 154 KB\n\nDune 2\nLPs can leave, but the users will stick with Uniswap, and the remaining LPs will continue to earn significant fees. The below table shows the number of dollars earned by LPs over the last six months. Despite popular sentiment, LPs are making great money.\n\n708×342 20.5 KB\n\n\nWhat about the regulatory implications of this proposal?\n\nGFX Labs is not equipped to address the regulatory implications of this proposal. While GFX Labs is based in the USA, the protocol is not based in any one country and has token holders and users globally. We encourage token holders with concerns to voice them and vote with their tokens for their desired outcome.",

        "replyFullContent": "We (Michigan Blockchain 3) believe that there certainly needs to be progress made on the fee-switch front, as operationally, this process will take some time to fully complete, from proposal discussions & voting to actual technical implementation–and we believe that GFX is a highly qualified team to spearhead this initiative due to their track record in Uniswap governance.\nSummary of our decision:\n\nFee switch should be activated, and collected fees should be directed to the treasury\nFees should be converted to USDC for hedging treasury’s downside risk due to $UNI overexposure (an understatement)\nMore conversations should be had regarding long-term treasury management (separate proposal for this)\nPolygon or Arbitrum seem like fitting ecosystems to start fee switch implementation\nAll pools with sufficient volume may be activated, but the ⅕ fee tier is aggressive and should be lowered\nMost of the operations here are sound, but the biggest bottleneck is the legal clarity, which, in our eyes, cannot be a separate discussion as the implementation of the fee switch hinges on the legal/tax. Since GFX provides technical expertise, we believe a simultaneous legal discussion needs to be fleshed out in parallel with this proposal. The main consideration here will be regarding income tax and not securities law since, according to this proposal, the DAO alone will have income, but other stakeholders like $UNI holders won’t (yet) receive dividends. A justifiable compromise, however, may be paying any income tax from the USDC that the treasury holds upon the DAO’s approval.\n\n\n\nTreating Uniswap as a Business\nAn important consideration we need to think on is the mismatch between protocol value creation vs protocol value accrual. Uniswap has been an extremely valuable asset to the industry, available on multiple chains, driving billions of dollars of volume daily. As far as PMF goes, Uniswap has it–and in compensation, the protocol should earn a due portion of the fees. No revenue for the protocol effectively makes Uniswap an unprofitable business, and as delegates, we ideally like to view the protocol as a self-sustaining business. This is one of the reasons why we’ve been such large proponents of multi-chain expansion, which is akin to evolving a domestic corporation into a multinational enterprise.\nOf course, the current treasury has an AUM of ~$2B 4–which can be heavily discounted since 99.9% of it is in $UNI tokens–so the protocol is overall financially sound. But a strong balance sheet does not warrant an absent cash flow stream. Therefore, we are in favor of generally implementing the fee switch. The caveat is that treasury management should become a more important focus for the DAO (the specificities are out of this proposal’s scope). So what should we do with the fees earned from the fee switch? We should begin diversifying the treasury by converting the earned yield into a mixed pool of stablecoins to hedge the treasury’s downside. For simplicity, we can just start by selling the collected fees for USDC. Evidently, the treasury has lost 87% of its value 2 over the past 2 years, so this seems like a logical step forward while a more robust treasury management plan is fleshed out.\n\nEcosystem Selection\nAs for which ecosystem’s fees should be turned on, Polygon seems like a good choice. A primary concern about the fee switch is that Uniswap will lose market share in the ecosystems that enact the fee switch as it becomes less favorable for LPs (makers). But YTD, v3’s volume-based market share on Polygon has straddled between 70% - 85%, generally increasing over time (this data is a month behind). Although Quickswap on Polygon still drives large volume, like today, it had $225M of volume vs Uniswap at $370M. Arbitrum is another good contender. Optimism is less favorable than Polygon and Arb since Velodrome still has sizable market share in the OP market. Overall, we’re good to start with either Polygon or Arbitrum, with a bias towards Polygon.\n\nScreen Shot 2023-05-11 at 4.14.49 PM1412×796 90.3 KB\n\nSource\n\nLegal Clarity is the Bottleneck\nThat being said, our main concern remains the legal side. How will the protocol go about paying income tax? We realize that this question is outside the scope of the proposal–but doesn’t seem like a viable direction to adopt since the rest of the proposal seems to hinge on the regulatory clarity behind enacting the fee switch. And since that is one of the most prominent bottlenecks, we believe that legal considerations must be taken into account in parallel with a technical/operational proposal like this one.",

        "replyFullContent": "Awesome to see a detailed proposal on this topic from highly competent delegates that can see it through to deployment!\nI think many community members and delegates would vote in favor of this proposal as is, with the default token that’s swapped for and held in treasury to be ETH.\nOn the topic of tax implications, I can’t seem to follow the logic or concerns raised in this thread. The primary concern seems to be that the protocol has tax liabilities once a fee switch is activated. By that logic, every ETH holder (or validator) would have tax obligations for pending transaction fees in the mempool even if they don’t receive them directly.\nThe above logic could also be applied to BTC holders (or at home miners). They too would have tax obligations for the transaction fees pending in the mempool even if they don’t receive them.\nA more direct example would be the Compound DAO which has control over the protocol reserve which accrues cTokens paid by borrowers. Every Compound market has a Reserve Factor which represents a portion of borrower’s interest that is converted to protocol reserves.\nI should note that Aave protocol functions similarly to Compound in regards to the above example.\nSurely we’re not suggesting that Compound or Aave DAOs owe years worth of taxes for simply having control over the protocol reserves \nIf the concerns around tax implications were legitimate, wouldn’t we have to assume that every single vested UNI that has accrued to the DAO controlled treasury caused a taxable event? UNI token holders do control that treasury the same way they would with a fee switch pool after all.\nI feel like its a bit of a reach, to be quite honest, and I don’t think there is sufficient precedent to impede a proposal such as this one for the cited tax reasons unless there is a legal professional that can provide case law to the contrary.",

Capturing fees from thousands of token pairs would be a logistical nightmare.\nWe had a similar problem to solve for PoolTogether V5, so I want to share our solution with you!\nOur Requirements:\n\nNeeded a mechanism to sell token A for token B\nToken A accrues slowly, and Token A liquidity is held in an external contract\nCannot use an oracle, because there will be obscure tokens\nMust be fully automated, because there will be many tokens\nIs not prescriptive on where liquidity comes from; it should be open and allow token B to come from anywhere.\n\nOur Solution:\nThe Liquidation Pair: a single-sided virtual AMM based on the CPMM x*y=k.  You can find the full explanation here 1.\nHere is the Liquidation Pair on Github 1\nThe Liquidation Pair has Token A and wants Token B, so it only supports B → A swaps.\nHow it works:\n\nThe Liquidation Pair stores a virtual reserve A and reserve B amounts. These are configured at creation time. Generally we just make sure it’s a small amount.\nThe “total” reserve A is actually virtual reserve A + available A liquidity, so as liquidity accrues the liquidity balance shifts and it becomes an arbitrage opportunity\nArbers swap Token B for Token A when the shift becomes profitable\nThe tokens from the arb can be sent anywhere and trigger a callback; that is configured when the liquidation pair is created.\n\nThe algorithm also includes an additional mechanism to ensure the liquidation price tracks the market price accurately and adjusts K automatically so that the virtual reserve amounts are proportional to the rate of accrual. See the link to the full explanation above!\nIf you move forward with the proposal, then I hope you find the code useful!  The PoolTogether team is happy to answer any questions you have.

        "replyFullContent": "Thanks for the proposal @GFXlabs!\nThe discussion around Uniswap’s fee switch has been ongoing for a while now with various alternatives proposed, introducing different trade-offs at various levels of the protocol. Tax implications aside, the idea of a fee switch seems counterintuitive at the protocol level as it directly levies a tax on LPs, and indirectly on users (traders) assuming liquidity diminishes. It’s also probably hard to find a mechanism that uses the revenue from the fee switch to generate a surplus for the protocol (i.e., post-fee switch revenue > pre-fee switch revenue).\nHowever, if we think about revenue benefits at the DAO level it can begin to make sense for the protocol to start accruing fees to the DAO’s treasury to ensure Uniswap’s longevity. Largely, reducing the need to sell large amounts of UNI to fund development and operational costs, which come at the cost of UNI holders. But more importantly, becoming a self-sustaining DAO through revenue earned by the protocol.\nSo we encourage the experimentation of the fee-switch and think that Uniswap is in a good position to do so. We also believe that once live, having an active treasury opens up the next chapter of decentralization for the protocol as it begins to attract service providers from the treasury management realm and ‘risk’ teams to assess which pools should have an active fee switch.\nSome thoughts on your questions:\n\nDo you agree Uniswap does not need to offer substantial fee rebates to liquidity providers?\n\n\n\n\n GFXlabs:\n\nUniswap is the only major exchange that pays Makers (in DeFi lingo - Liquidity Providers).\n\n\nThis is slightly misguided as there are major exchanges that offer maker rebates (e.g. Bybit). However, most of these fee structures are only available to high-volume liquidity providers. Nonetheless, we believe the current rebates are sufficient even with a 1/5 protocol fee; catering to Uniswap’s supply side is important for the protocol to remain competitive.\n\nDo you agree a one-fifth fee tier is the appropriate starting point for a protocol fee?\n\nYes, it’s likely sufficient enough to understand the implications of the fee switch and somewhat in line with what order book exchanges capture at the higher end of their discount tiers.\n\nDo you agree a new system for fee management is a good approach to carrying out the necessary maintenance surrounding the fee switch?\n\nThe proposed solution is great and allowing anyone to call the fee collector contract is a nice addition. Having the ability to call setFeeProtocol over 10 times is important for reducing governance fatigue.\nOne question we had and is related to Q5, will there be a token whitelist function that blocks certain tokens from being sold when the fee collection contract is called? e.g. If the DAO decides ETH, USDC, and USDT are assets that want to be held, it doesn’t make sense to sell these assets only to rebuy them in the token consolidation phase.\n\nWhat token do you think the DAO should trade fee income for to be held in the protocol treasury?\n\nWe don’t have a strong opinion on this but an obvious starting point would be a set of stablecoins to begin building a safe and strong financial foundation.",

        "replyFullContent": "Thanks for writing this up! It’s an exciting proposal.\nI think this proposal is a nice iteration in several ways over the one that @guil-lambert and I wrote up. However, I am going to focus on where I’d like to see continued work before I would support it.\nI believe this proposal shares the same weakness that the proposal Guillaume and I had… it does not address what to do with any fees collected.\nI’ve come to the strong belief that any fees collected by the protocol should be autonomously distributed in a programmatic way. There is a big design space in what that could look like but the main point is that they should not simply collect to a treasury where they are then arbitrarily distributed based on later token votes. My reasons for this belief are the following:\n\n\nToken holders have a very poor track record in managing protocol treasuries via discrete voting. It has not proven to be efficient or effective.\n\n\nIdeologically, this is much more aligned with traditional crypto ethos of immutable, forever software. Contra some other commenters, I strongly disagree with the view that the Uniswap protocol is a business… it absolutely is not a business. It is an autonomous piece of software, it doesn’t have employees, it can’t go bankrupt, it doesn’t have revenue and expenses. Protocols are a revolutionary new entity type and we need to think of them as such.\n\n\nAlthough we would still need to be thoughtful about regulatory and tax considerations, the autonomous redistribution should be a much more vanilla tax / regulatory position (i.e. this is the same as how ETH staking works).\n\n\nI think this proposal is a step in the right direction but the crucial piece I outlined above needs to be addressed before I can support it.",

        "replyFullContent": "Relaying Leighton’s post:\nA trustless system designed to collect fees in the pool, and swapping the protocol fees to be claimable for a designated token should add no more additional taxation responsbility to what LPs are currently responsible for. Unless there is a legal & taxation professional to contest, it appears straightforward that eliminating the requirement for a common enterprise to manage fees also eliminates the debate of legal & taxation concerns.  Anecdotally, I’ve never seen any hard evidence on cited laws within these forums proving any impact to the intersection of Uniswap Protocol, Uniswap Labs, and its users regarding the legality of the protocol fees.  Unless the cited laws carry merit to being catastrophic towards furthering the protocol fee, the community should just cope with the idea that you can sue anyone for anything.\nI believe activating the protocol fee is fairly zero-sum. Here are some reponses to the fantastic proposal:\n\n\nDo you agree Uniswap does not need to offer substantial fee rebates to liquidity providers?\n\n\nIn a different lens, turning on the protocol fee could provide a like-for-like rebate via a hedge for LPs. In light of the fact that Liquidity Providing in volatile Uniswap pairs without considering a larger strategy - absent of protocol revenue mechanisms to hedge - is simply a bad idea.\n\n\nDo you agree a one-fifth fee tier is the appropriate starting point for a protocol fee?\n\n\nYes, a one-fifth fee tier represents a negligble impact to Liquidity Providers. It’s reasonable to assume that the overwhelming amount of users will always trade on Uniswap regardless of price impact - mostly because they don’t bother to check agregators or other DEXs for fractional savings in slippage. There has been some great research done by @rfritsch on this: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04634.pdf 4.\n\n\nDo you agree a new system for fee management is a good approach to carrying out the necessary maintenance surrounding the fee switch?\n\n\nYes, and I believe that funding the design of a PoC system, writing the smart contract(s), and a third-party audit of a deployment strategy is well-suited use of treasury funds.\n\n\nDo you agree implementing the system on Polygon is a good first step?\n\n\nTesting on Polygon and Arbitrum seems fitting before deploying on mainnet.\n\n\nWhat token do you think the DAO should trade fee income for to be held in the protocol treasury?\n\n\nProtocol fees should be converted to the native protocol token: UNI. Trading fee income to stablecoins or alternative tokens should be decided upon by the claimant.",

Some background about Native, we are a boutique advisory firm founded by @Kydo\n\nWe are thankful to @GFXlabs for producing an informative post on the Fee Switch. It effectively outlines the mechanism of the Fee Switch and provides data on its implications. We also recommend delegates to revisit @Stastny’s post here 1 regarding their Fee Switch report.\nClose to 300 forum messages have been exchanged in the Fee Switch discussion, and, as @Leighton has mentioned, we have not made much progress. We believe there are two primary reasons for this.\nThe minor factor is the lack of on-chain votes tracking our progress in the conversation. We should be continuously making progress on the previous discussion instead of having one vote to sort everything out.\nThe principal cause is the regulatory ambiguity surrounding the Fee Switch. The tax and security-like implications have significant consequences for those currently working at the lab and the foundation.\nNevertheless, we cannot wait for regulation forever.\nThis is Native’s proposal to move past this stalemate. The idea is to slowly build towards a comprehensive fee switch design (legal, smart contract, future fee usage, etc)\nWe should break down this decision into smaller parts and set a deadline for the Fee Switch to be activated. If the Fee Switch is not turned on by the deadline, a simple backup strategy will be executed (eg. all main v3 pools on Polygon will be turned on).\nHere is our proposed plan:\n\nDAO votes on whether the Fee Switch should be activated in the future (time and mechanism indifferent).\nDAO decides on a backup Fee Switch plan and deadline for a Fee Switch decision (time and mechanism sensitive).\nDAO establishes a committee to propose a plan on the legal and mechanism design for the Fee Switch.\nIf the DAO approves the committee proposal, the backup Fee Switch plan is forfeited.\nIf the DAO does not approve the committee proposal before the deadline, the backup plan is implemented.\n\nWe do not consider this to be the definitive plan to bring about meaningful change for the protocol; however, we are confident that making gradual progress is essential to the conversation about the fee switch.\nAnswering @GFXlabs originally proposed questions to keep the conversation moving forward:\n\nDo you agree Uniswap does not need to offer substantial fee rebates to liquidity providers? Unlike traditional markets, the Uni LP’s strategy space is much more limited, therefore the high rebate is not as unjustified. However, we do believe exploring with the exact rebate amount is meaningful.\n\nDo you agree a one-fifth fee tier is the appropriate starting point for a protocol fee? Yes.\n\nDo you agree a new system for fee management is a good approach to carrying out the necessary maintenance surrounding the fee switch? Yes given the rigid collectProtocol() function.\n\nDo you agree implementing the system on Polygon is a good first step? Yes. We are indifferent among the L2s.\n\nWhat token do you think the DAO should trade fee income for to be held in the protocol treasury? USD-stablecoins and ETH are both acceptable.\n\n",

We believe there are two primary reasons for this\n\n\nBased on my understanding, previous fee switch proposals did not originate from highly active delegates, such as GFX Labs, who possess substantial UNI delegations and have already presented multiple Uniswap proposals from Forum Discussion to on-chain voting and execution. This lack of active follow-up by previous proposers, possibly due to other commitments or limited resources, could be a contributing factor in their proposals not gaining much traction.\nRegarding the mentioned concerns about taxes, I would like to inquire about your thoughts on the fact that the treasury has been accumulating value in the form of vested UNI tokens since September 2020. How do you perceive the distinction here? If you consider the control of a value-accumulating treasury as equivalent to running an enterprise, what about the billions of dollars that have gradually vested to the DAO-controlled treasury over nearly three years? Drawing a parallel between a fee switch pool controlled by the treasury and a UNI pool controlled by the treasury, which vests UNI tokens created by Uniswap Labs, doesn’t require legal expertise. This is particularly evident when considering that the UNI tokens from the treasury have been utilized to pay for services and grants.\nFurthermore, I have mentioned other examples in this thread, such as the Compound and Aave protocols, both of which have a concept called a ReserveFactor. This function enables the protocol to accumulate value through debt tokens paid by borrowers and controlled by token holders. Recently, AAVE token holders voted to utilize a portion of their protocol reserves, showcasing complete autonomy over DAO-controlled assets.\nThe main point I wish to emphasize is that the tax and security concerns raised about the Uniswap DAO and its token do not have basis in precedent, yet they continue to be reiterated on this forum. Another U.S.-based protocol, Compound, has already established a clear precedent on this matter, which Uniswap has structurally mirrored in many ways.\nI fail to comprehend how we can expect highly active delegates to disregard community support and token holder approval, especially when previous snapshot polls have shown support for some form of fee switch. It seems inappropriate to impede this proposal due to opinions on the forum that lack factual basis and do not align with the technical functioning of blockchain protocols.\nFor those expressing “legal concerns” regarding this proposal, it would be more appropriate to reference legal precedents rather than relying on views propagated on Twitter or elsewhere. Many law-abiding protocols, including Uniswap, already possess a value-accumulating treasury.\nAdopting the legal stance that some have voiced in this thread would essentially mean that almost every DAO (once again Uniswap included!) are already violating tax laws.\nSince this proposal is a technical one that does not aim to distribute the funds accrued by a DAO-controlled pool, I believe it is best to encourage further technical discussions at this stage, allowing us to focus on the remaining technical uncertainties.\nIf there are genuine legal concerns, the proposers deserve well-founded arguments supported by facts, either from legal professionals or by citing relevant case law, explaining why they should not proceed with the proposal after receiving feedback.\nUltimately, if this proposal indeed carries catastrophic legal implications, those with voting power who hold such concerns should exercise their votes when we proceed to an on-chain vote. This approach would be the fairest way forward, adhering to the protocol’s rules and to token holders’ beliefs.",

Additionally, we’d like all pools that currently meet this criteria officially listed.\n\n\nWho will be building the contract that sits between the timelock and the factory?

Additionally, we highly recommend the use of an application like Milkman in place of selling via the Uniswap router in order to mitigate MEV and frontrunning. This has been a huge problem for Curve and Sushi who employ similar models.\n\n\nWe agree with Leighton’s sentiment that a discussion around the use of the funds should begin prior to the implementation of this proposal, but disagree that it should pose a roadblock to its passing.\nWe view this fee switch proposal as an experiment that tests the protocol’s ability to turn on the fee switch without disrupting the DEX. A use for the revenue is far more vital prior to the implementation on mainnet. This should be a barrier to mainnet deployment rather than testing. After all, Polygon V3 pools only make up ~5% of the total V3 volume and ~2.5% of the total V3 TVL.\nWe have many ideas for using protocol revenue, which we will include in a separate discussion surrounding this topic. Having a diverse and powerful treasury is a huge benefit to the protocol in itself and dependent on total revenue received, the optimal use cases may vary.",

        "replyFullContent": "\nTL;DR I strongly disagree with this proposal.\nThe Uniswap infrastructure is a public good. Turning on the fee switch in this manner would  lead to the deterioration of the Uniswap protocol’s public good nature (in a very tragedy of the commons-like manner) and would undoubtedly push the $UNI token closer to being a security.\nI’ll try to be concise my response, but for those that want to better understand my competing (?) view, please read this post about how I think the proposal to turn on the fee switch should come from protocols themselves 5, not UNI token holders.\n\n\nWhy this is bad economics and poor long-term planning\nThinking about the fees switch in terms of revenues misses the point: the Uniswap smart contracts have no expenses, no payroll, and no COE/board/managing entity. The smart contracts will continue to operate long after all of us are dead. To echo what @Leighton has said:\n\n[Uniswap] is an autonomous piece of software, it doesn’t have employees, it can’t go bankrupt, it doesn’t have revenue and expenses. Protocols are a revolutionary new entity type and we need to think of them as such.\n\nThe protocol does not exactly “need” revenues to operate. Token holders may want a slice of the pie, but any proposal that enact a return of the collected fees to $UNI token holders would unequivocally make the $UNI token a security – it is easies to make the argument that the $UNI token satisfies the Howey test prongs 3+4: (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profit, or (4) to be derived from the efforts of others.\nEspousing a securities role for the $UNI token, the largest DeFi protocol, would certainly create a precedent --and I’m OK if that’s the route the UniswapDAO wants to take-- but it would also create a huge target on the back of the UniswapDAO in the eyes of the sεc and other regulatory agencies.\n\nAnswer to Key questions\nThinking in terms of public goods management, the question UniswapDAO voters need to ask themselves is: how is that fee switch proposal contributing to the sustainable growth of the Uniswap protocol (and not of the $UNI token)?\nI don’t really grasp how decreasing the revenues for liquidity providers on all* Uniswap v3 pool grows the protocol. LPs can, and definitely will, move to a different fork of Uni v3 if they’re unhappy.\nMy answers to @GFXlabs’ questions:\n\nDo you agree Uniswap does not need to offer substantial fee rebates to liquidity providers?\n\n\nNot at all. CEXs and DEXs are two completely different economies. Comparing maker-taker fees on CEXs to Uniswap is like comparing the cost of a stamp to the cost of sending an email (ie. look, it costs 0.5$ to send a letter, email should at least cost 0.1$!).\n\n\nDo you agree a one-fifth fee tier is the appropriate starting point for a protocol fee?\n\n\nI reject the premise that the UniswapDAO should be turning on the fee switch for all* Uniswap v3 pools.\n\n\nDo you agree a new system for fee management is a good approach to carrying out the necessary maintenance surrounding the fee switch?\n\n\nNo. I don’t think we should be compromising on security by implementing a new on-chain system to execute DAO operations. Having to vote every day and potentially spend 30M gas for doing so should not be seen as an “inefficient process for the protocol to upkeep”. It’s a feature not a bug.\n\n\nDo you agree implementing the system on Polygon is a good first step?\n\n\nNo. A good first step would be The Uniswap DAO turning on the fee switch for the ETH-UNI-30bps pool. In fact, all protocols should be requesting to turn on the fee switch on their own token pools. Let protocols XYZ figure out the tax+securities implications for their own token, and let the Uniswap DAO be the credibly neutral overseer of that process.\n\n\nWhat token do you think the DAO should trade fee income for to be held in the protocol treasury?\n\n\nI am against the view that the fee switch revenue should touch the treasury in any way.  We must first figure out how to handle the tax/securities implications of capture protocol fees, and be ready to jump through Gary’s hoops if the UniswapDAO chooses to make the $UNI token closer to a security.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI firmly believe that the proposal to turn on the fee switch for all* Uniswap v3 pools as described by @GFXlabs should not be enacted.\nThe Uniswap protocol, as a public good, should prioritize sustainable growth and the overall health of the ecosystem. This involves ensuring liquidity providers are adequately incentivized and maintaining the neutral status of the Uniswap DAO. While revenue generation may seem attractive, it could potentially turn the $UNI token into a security and attract unwanted regulatory attention.\nThe decisions we make today are shaping the future of Uniswap. It is crucial that we think critically about the long-term implications of any vote, and ensure that they align with the core principles of Uniswap: decentralization, openness, and neutrality.",

    "fullContent": "[Governance Proposal]\nDeploy Uniswap V3 on zkSync\nFranklinDAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Uniswap V3 on zkSync.\nMatter Labs: @zkSync\nProposal History\nThe consensus check 44 passed with 24M (~100%) YES votes. The temperature check 139 passed with 15M (~100%) YES votes.\nThe onchain vote can be found here: Uniswap Interface 119\nSummary\nTo support Uniswap’s multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.\n\nzkSync ecosystem has over 100 projects 55 committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\nDeploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\nzkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved.\nAbout zkSync\nzkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup 10 that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\n\n\nEVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps\n\nToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools\n\nEthos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source\n\nCertainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability\n\nFuture Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code\n\nThere is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync’s EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin 2 recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.\nSecurity & Bridges\nZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum. There is a general L1<>L2 communication bridge which will support arbitrary message passing and secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus.\nBridge validators can’t pass an incorrect message or change the content, the worst case would be to censor everyone. Importantly, we’ll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity.\nSecurity is top of mind 3 for zkSync. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program 3.\nProposal\nThere’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.\nImportantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects 55 and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswap’s influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups.\nWhile the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the network’s adoption and in turn, Uniswap’s usage.\nLicense Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Matter Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on zkSync provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs through the “Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 39” albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team.\nTimeline\nFollowing the Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync.\nzkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet in October 12. A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because it’s fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswap’s relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem.16",

    "fullContent": "The tentative deadline to provide feedback on the process below is Friday, February 17th. This date may be pushed back further, if required for further feedback and iteration. (Date updated from a previous version of this proposal)\nHi all, as I mentioned in the BSC Deployment Proposal 100 comments, it is clear that cross-chain proposals, and specifically the choice of which bridge to use, can be improved for all governance stakeholders.\nWe also note that the BSC Deployment process will continue to move forward with the steps stated in that comment. There is a Snapshot Poll 81 to select a bridge going on now that will end on Tuesday Jan. 31. The final BSC Governance vote will kick off after that, with the selected bridge.\nAs for the Assessment Process and Team, our proposal is as follows. Note we are seeking feedback on the process, as well as nominations for team members, and applications from bridge providers.\nThe outputs and process below aim to:\n\nSupport delegates and community members in making informed decisions related to cross-chain deployments.\nProvide process clarity to bridge providers.\nRemove inefficiency in the governance process moving forward for all governance stakeholders.\n\n\nDeliverables\nWe believe the deliverables below would be beneficial to the Uniswap community as a whole. The UF will support a process that will generate the following:\n\nAn extensive review of bridge providers which:\na. Verifies key information about the bridge (template below)\nb. Identifies risk vectors to Uniswap governance, assigning them a risk level (Green, Yellow, Red)\nRecommendation of one or multiple approaches in which to select bridge providers (and/or agnostic solution(s)) per deployment moving forward. This approach, or approaches, should be actionable in the short term in order to cater to cross-chain proposals put forth prior to the BSL expiry on April 1st, or shortly thereafter. This could take a number of forms, including for example diversifying deployments across a set of trusted bridges (on a 1/n basis, or otherwise).\nRecommendation of one or multiple ways in which this team, or others, may continue to monitor bridge risk and support the community in the governance process on an ongoing basis.\nRecommendation of one or multiple ways in Uniswap governance may approach bridging over a longer-term timeframe.\n\n\nProcess\nTo create the deliverables above, we propose the following process:\nSelection of a team of 4 engineers and 1 project manager\n\nThese individuals should be available for 10-15 hours per week over the next few weeks to participate in the assessment process, and to write up their findings in a report to share with the community.\nEach engineer will be compensated $300/hour. The PM will be compensated $200/hour.\nThese individuals should not be on a bridge team or have a vested interest in any bridge. If there are any remaining conflicts of interest, outside of being on a bridge team or having a vested interest in a bridge team, those should be disclosed. The UF will do the best it can to select a team with no conflicts of interest whatsoever. However, we note that it is likely that those who are most adept at inspecting bridges and similar solutions may now or in the past have worked with a bridge or related team in some fashion in the past (I.e., bridge aggregator teams). If an otherwise fantastic candidate has some conflict, that will be disclosed upon the announcement of the team.\n\nThe UF plans to select the engineers who will be participating in the group. Selection criteria for the engineers will include the following: relevant technical experience, understanding of bridge architectures and potential risk vectors, and alignment with Uniswap’s interests. For the PM role, selection criteria will include organizational skills, experience with technical writing, context into bridge architectures and potential risk vectors, and alignment with Uniswap’s interests.\nThe UF has a shortlist of candidates already, and we would love for additional candidates to be proposed in the forum below. For those who wish to nominate themselves, please post the following information in the forum below:\na. Name, affiliation, Twitter handle\nb. Qualifications as they relate to the criteria stated above, stated briefly\nc. Explanation of why you are interested in becoming a member of this team\nWe will wait to finalize the team selection process until community feedback has been provided and incorporated through at least February 17th. In the interim we are excited for candidates to raise their hands and introduce themselves.\n\nSelection of a set of bridges to review. This list should include, to start, deBridge, Celer, Wormhole, LayerZero, and the bridge-agnostic solutions which have been proposed thus far (for example, Kydo’s MMA design and Celer’s Multi bridge implementation) To be included in the assessment, a bridge must:\n\nBe launched on mainnet, and have audits completed by at least two audit firms\nAnswer the questions listed below in the forum. Please post responses to the question directly, do not alter the format of your response from Q&A. (We ask deBridge, Celer, Wormhole, LayerZero, and the developers of agnostic solutions to provide answers below to consolidate information for the assessment team - previous responses from BSC forum post may be used if relevant.)\n\nPay $5,000 in USDC to the Uniswap Foundation, to cover part of the payment to the assessment team, prior to the assessment beginning. The intention of this fee is to test a compensation model for this team to provide governance support on an ongoing basis.\nAlternative solutions such as the agnostic solutions cited above will be included in the assessment.\n\nAn assessment process: engineers should review the answers to the questions on the bridges in the comments below, then take steps to verify that information through a review of developer documentation, audits, smart contracts directly, and discussions with the bridge team. Further diligence into other risk vectors which may not be directly addressed in the questions below should be conducted by the team as well. Previous discussions in the forum  (for instance, the chain on Other Internet’s UGM 7 process) may also be reviewed for added context.\nA report, published to the community. This report should include the 3 deliverables listed above.\n\nTimeframe\nWe propose the following timeframe for the process described above:\nThrough Friday, Feb. 17 (or further into the future, as mentioned above)\n\n\nCommunity provides feedback on the proposal suggested above.\n\nBridges submit their interest in being considered by answering the questions below in the forum.\n\nAssessment team candidates respond in the forum below with the information required (Name, affiliation, Twitter handle, fulfillment of criteria, interest). We have proposed steps below by which applicants will be chosen for the final team, though we may receive community feedback to adjust this process prior to February 17th.\n\nWednesday, Feb. 23\n\nAnnounce the final process to be used, incorporating community feedback (this may include adjustments to the team selection process)\nAnnounce the list of bridges to be considered\nAnnounce the list of assessment team members\n\nMonday, March 20\nInitial reviews of all bridges conducted.\nMonday, March 27\nFinal report published with community recommendations.\n\nTeam Member Application\n\nPhase 1\nPlease provide the following information in the comments below.\na. Name, affiliation, Twitter handle\nb. Qualifications as they relate to the criteria stated above, stated briefly\nc. Explanation of why you are interested in becoming a member of this team\n\nPhase 2\nWe propose that final team members should be chosen in the following manner. We are open to receiving feedback on this approach, and welcome that feedback in the comments below.\n\nEach applicant (without any disqualifying characteristics, for instance close association to a bridge team) has a 30 minute interview with the Uniswap Foundation team.\nEach applicant provides a referral to vouch to the applicant’s ability to effectively fulfill this role.\nUF confirms applicant’s independence, to the extent possible.\nUF selects final team members. UF provides an explanation as to why each team member was chosen.\n\n\nBridge Questions\nPlease answer all these questions for the current deployed version of your bridge in a comment below. Your response should directly answer these questions in Q&A format - please do not alter the format of your response.\n\nList 3 succinct reasons why you believe your bridge/solution would best serve Uniswap governance.\nHow long has the system been running on mainnet?\nHow much value has the system secured? (Current TVL, total transaction volume)\nProvide a background on your team.\nPlease link your developer documentation.\nDoes the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\nHas the current deployed bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?\nIs there a bug bounty program?\nList ANY portion of the functional bridge that is upgradeable and explain how the upgrade process works.\nDo any contracts have an owner or owner-like entity? If so, what can the owner do?\nWhat is the security model of the bridge? Please describe the security model for the current implementation of the bridge. What trust assumptions are you making?\nHow can an adversary pass a fraudulent message from Ethereum to the destination chain?

        "replyFullContent": "\nMulti-Message-Aggregation (MMA)\nA General Design for Multi-Bridge Governance.\n\nAbstract\nMulti-Message-Aggregation (MMA) is a message aggregation method for Uniswap to securely relay governance instructions from Ethereum to another chain. Instead of making one bridge provider the default message relayer, MMA relies on multiple bridge providers and a group of signers. This design offers more security than any one bridge and is designed for governance-related tasks. Moreover, this design is relatively engineering-lite and can be implemented in a reasonable time.\n\nCompared to the existing design\nCompared to the Universal Governance Model 11 by @AlexSmirnov @modong , this design does not rely on an algorithmically onchain selecting function. We believe this mechanism should be reserved for future implementation due to 1) its potentially long engineering time, 2) new attack surface/bugs due to increased code complexity, and 3) the difficulty to standardize messaging formats across bridge providers. Instead, we delegate this algorithmic function to a 11/15 multisig. The multisig will select the message which will be executed. This way, we believe while keeping the contract complexity and engineering time low, we can still achieve high-security guarantees.\n\nMMA Design\n\n1102×742 46.3 KB\n\nThe MMA design can be split into three parts. Ethereum, the destination chain, and the off-chain world. On Ethereum, it is made up of the Uniswap Governance Complex (refers to the smart contracts that Uniswap relies on to issue governance actions) and individual bridge endpoints. In the off-chain world, there are bridge providers and multisig signers. On the destination chain, there are bridge endpoints, a message selection contract, and Uniswap contracts.\nOn Ethereum, once a governance proposal is approved and is related to deployments on other chains, the governance complex will send messages to each individual bridge endpoints for relaying to the destination chain(s). For simplicity, we will assume we are only sending governance message to one destination chain, but the concept is the same when sending to multiple chains. This design will not change the current voting process but would require the governance payload to be modified if cross-chain governance is involved.\nOnce the message reached the endpoint on the Ethereum side, each bridge provider will handle relaying the message to the destination chain independently.\nOnce the bridge provider relayed the message to the destination chain’s endpoint, the endpoint will send the message into the Message Selection Contract. The multisig will then select which message to execute and submit a transaction executing the message on the destination chain. We are recommending an 11/15 Safe multisig.\nThe rough implementation of the Message Selection Contract can be found here 6.\n\n723×590 86.8 KB\n\n\nSecurity\nTwo kinds of malicious activities could surface: 1) fradulent governance message and 2) withholding attack.\nA fradulent governance message is a governance message that got executed on the destination chain but was not approved by the Ethereum Uniswap Governance Complex. This can happen if and only if an adversary took control of one or more of the bridge providers AND more than 11 of the multisig signers. The adversary would first need to use the bridge provider to pass in a fradulent governance message into the Message Selection Contract and then use the 11 of the signers to approve the transaction to be executed. We believe this is unlikely to happen because hacking 11 independent signers and a bridge provider is not economically profitable to attack the governance bridge.\nA withholding attack is when more than 4 of the multisig signers or all of the bridge providers refuse to sign or relay the message. Bridge’s withholding attack would be a concern if Uniswap has only one bridge provider; however, given we have three in this example, simultaneous withholding attacks from the bridge providers would be extremely unlikely. Multisig signers’ withholding attack could be more likely given the small subset of the participants involved. To address this problem, we should have a governance process to elect only the reputable governance delegate for this multisig role; alternatively, we could increase the total multisig size to make a withholding attack harder to coordinate.\n\nSummary\nWe proposed a cross-chain governance mechanism, Multi-Message-Aggregation (MMA). This design aggregates messages relayed by bridge providers and a group of multisig signers select which message from the set to execute. MMA aims to be an intermediary solution for cross-chain governance between relying on one bridge provider and algorithmically aggregating multiple bridge providers. The security guarantee of MMA is also higher when compared to a single bridge provider.\nWe would love to hear thoughts from other technical members within the Uniswap ecosystem on MMA and the potential security vulnerability or engineering difficulties involved.",

A message with multiple copies are sent through different bridges to the destination chains, and will only be executed at the destination chain when the same message has been delivered by a quorum of different bridges.\nThe current solution are designed for messages being sent from one source chain to multiple destination chains. It also requires that there is only one permitted sender on the source chain. This would be the use case for Uniswap governance contract on Ethereum\ncalling remote functions of contracts on other EVM chains.\n\nWorkflow\n\nSend message on source chain\nTo send a message to execute a remote call on the destintion chain, sender on the source chain should call remoteCall() of MultiBridgeSender, which invokes sendMessage() of every bridge sender apdater to send messages via different message bridges.\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Source chain                                                                                            │\n│                                                                                                         │\n│                                                             ┌─────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐ │\n│                                                         ┌──►│ Bridge1 Adapter ├──►│ Bridge1 Contracts │ │\n│                                                         │   └─────────────────┘   └───────────────────┘ │\n│                                                         │                                               │\n│ ┌────────┐remoteCall()┌───────────────────┐sendMessage()│   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐ │\n│ │ Caller ├───────────►│ MultiBridgeSender ├─────────────┼──►│ Bridge2 Adapter ├──►│ Bridge2 Contracts │ │\n│ └────────┘            └───────────────────┘             │   └─────────────────┘   └───────────────────┘ │\n│                                                         │                                               │\n│                                                         │   ┌─────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐ │\n│                                                         └──►│ Bridge3 Adapter ├──►│ Bridge3 Contracts │ │\n│                                                             └─────────────────┘   └───────────────────┘ │\n│                                                                                                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\nReceive message on destination chain\nOn the destination chain, MultiBridgeReceiver receives messages from every bridge receiver adapter.

Only adapter with non-zero power has access to receiveMessage() function. If the accumulated power of a message has reached the a threshold, which means enough number of different bridges have delivered a same message, the message will be executed by the MultiBrideReceiver contract.\nThe message execution will invoke a function call according to the message content, which will either call functions of other contracts, or call the param adjustment functions of the MultiBridgeReceiver itself. Note that the only legit message sender is the trusted dApp contract on the source chain, which means only that single dApp contract has the ability to execute functions calls through the MultiBridgeReceiver contracts on different other chains.\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Destination chain                                                                                          │\n│                                                                                                            │\n│ ┌───────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐                                                                │\n│ │ Bridge1 Contracts ├──►│ Bridge1 Adapter ├──┐                                                             │\n│ └───────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘  │                                                             │\n│                                              │                                                             │\n│ ┌───────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐  │receiveMessage()┌─────────────────────┐ call()  ┌──────────┐ │\n│ │ Bridge1 Contracts ├──►│ Bridge2 Adapter ├──┼───────────────►│ MultiBridgeReceiver ├────────►│ Receiver │ │\n│ └───────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘  │                └─────────────────────┘         └──────────┘ │\n│                                              │                                                             │\n│ ┌───────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────┐  │                                                             │\n│ │ Bridge2 Contracts ├──►│ Bridge3 Adapter ├──┘                                                             │\n│ └───────────────────┘   └─────────────────┘                                                                │\n│                                                                                                            │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\nAdd new bridge and update threshold\nBelow are steps to add a new bridge (e.g. Bridge4) by the dApp community.\n\nBridge4 provider should implement and deploy Bridge4 adapters on source chain and all destination chains.

It requires a remoteCall() from the source chain Caller with calldata calling updateQuorumThreshold() of the MultiBridgeReceiver on the destination chain.\n\nExample\nUse case: contract A on Goerli send message to contract B on BSC Testnet in order to call enableFeeAmount() for state change. Apply a 2-of-3 messages governance model with message bridge C, D and E.\n\nDeployment and initialization\n\nDeploy MultiBridgeSender on Goerli, set address of A as allowed caller.\nDeploy MultiBridgeReceiver on BSC Testnet.\nEach message bridge provider prepare their own SenderAdapter and ReceiverAdapter, named with a prefix of their bridge name. Take preparation of CSenderAdapter and CReceiverAdapter as an example.\n\nDeploy CSenderAdapter on Goerli, set address of MultiBridgeSender as multiBridgeSender.\nDeploy CReceiverAdapter on BSC Testnet, set address of MultiBridgeReceiver as multiBridgeReceiver 1.\nCall updateReceiverAdapter() of CSenderAdapter, set address of CReceiverAdapter on BSC Testnet(chain id 97) as a valid ReceiverAdapter.\nCall updateSenderAdapter() of CReceiverAdapter, set address of CSenderAdapter on Goerli(chain id 5) as a valid SenderAdapter.\nTransfer ownership of CSenderAdapter and CReceiverAdapter to address(0).\n\n\nOnce all message bridges are ready, somehow let contract A call addSenderAdapters() of MultiBridgeSender with an address array of CSenderAdapter, DSenderAdapter and ESenderAdapter.\nCall initialize() of MultiBridgeReceiver, with an address array of CReceiverAdapter, DReceiverAdapter and EReceiverAdapter, and power threshold 2.\n\n\nSending your message\nPrepare a calldata for contract B for calling enableFeeAmount(), then somehow let contract A call remoteCall() of MultiBridgeSender with _dstChainId = 97, _target = <address of contract B> and _callData = <calldata you prepared>.\n\nResult\nImagine that the messages sent via C, D and E received by MultiBridgeReceiver on BSC Testnet in an order of 1.C 2.D 3.E. During receiving message sent via D, accumulated power reaches power threshold 2, which result in message execution(the calldata will be sent to contract B).\n\nNotes to the community\nWe are more than happy to answer any questions, help with tests, collaborate with similar-minded builders like @AlexSmirnov, iterate based on feedbacks and provide audits from community selected firms.\nAlthough Celer, being a 2018-vintage project, does not have the backing of large UNI-holding investors at this moment, we do trust the integrity and intelligence of all the Uniswap delegates to choose this positive-sum path that ensures the highest level of security and service quality for Uniswap’s multi-blockchain expansion.",

We believe it’s currently the only bridge that provides users and LPs with the full economic security of the network they’re on.\nAs much as we’d love to see Hop used by Uniswap for Ethereum <> BSC messaging, it’s likely not a good fit right now. Hop currently has the same dependency as Uniswap and relies on an existing message bridge with Ethereum for a network to be supported. If Hop were to add BSC support, we’d have the same discussion and analyze the same solutions discussed above. The chosen solution would act as a replacement for the native message bridge typically seen in rollup designs which Hop was built for. I do think the solutions discussed above are good enough for Uniswap’s use case given Uniswap’s tightly-scoped governance controls but likely have not achieved the level of trustlessness needed for Hop’s use case which involves the full custody of Hop-controlled assets on the spoke network.\nDown the road, if Uniswap has a need for sending trustless spoke-to-spoke messages, spoke-to-Ethereum messages, or synchronizing state across all networks, this is where the Hop Core Messenger and various messaging systems built on top can add the most value. In the meantime, we’ll be releasing some open-source contract libraries that may be useful, will continue to support the ERC-5164 initiative, and are eager to help here where we can.",

This helps to improve security by having more pairs of eyes on the code.\nEach bridge team should perform the integration and develop the adapter before the start of the assessment process, that allows the assessment team to use the source code and deployed implementation of the adapter to better understand the design of the bridge and review how integration will work in practice.\nThe multi-bridge solution is versatile and can increase security, even for blockchain ecosystems with a canonical bridge, which is just one of the bridges participating in the framework. In the event of a problem or vulnerability in the canonical bridge, malicious messages or proposals can be prevented as confirmations from non-canonical bridges are still required.\n\n\nCommunity feedback\nI also wanted to comment on the following points which @Kydo raised above:\n\n\n\n Kydo:\n\n\nits potentially long engineering time, 2) new attack surface/bugs due to increased code complexity, and 3) the difficulty to standardize messaging formats across bridge providers\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-bridge solution turned out to be relatively simple and not much different from vendor-locked integration. Complexities of each specific bridge integration are abstracted into adapters that are developed by each bridge team who wants to join the framework.\nLike with a single bridge integration, the code should undergo thorough testing by the community and pass security audits.\nThe advantage of the proposed solution is that standardization is achieved through adapters developed by each bridge team, providing a standardized approach across all bridges.\n\nWe’d love to hear feedback from @kydo and other community members on potential risks and problems of proposed implementation as well as ideas of what can be improved.\n\nRequest for Code Reviews and Security Audits\nCode reviews and security audits for the solution would help to assess security risks of the developed implementation.\nIf no significant issues or requests for improvements are identified within next 7 days, we will be ready to initiate and cover the cost of a security audit by Halborn.",

        "replyFullContent": "Hey all, Asa and Jon from Hyperlane here.\nWe believe that Uniswap’s governance bridge selection criteria should prioritize safety and lack of vendor lock-in. Since this is a governance based use-case, the clear parameter to optimize for in this case is safety, while others such as speed or cost are irrelevant. Given this we are in clear support for the Multi Message Aggregator (MMA) design proposed by @Kydo , and previously by others such as @blockchaincolumbia and several bridge providers.\nBelow, we make the case for support for the MMA, and how the MMA design can be implemented with Hyperlane.\n\nSafety via defense-in-depth\nWith respect to safety, believe the most important principle is defense-in-depth, a principle championed by the proposals from Kydo, Blockchain@Columbia, and others. In our opinion, the best approach to defense-in-depth is to aggregate the security models of multiple bridge providers as proposed by the MMA, as well as to optionally include security provided by elected members of the Uniswap community (e.g. via a Gnosis Safe).\nAs far as we can tell (and we are very biased), Hyperlane is the only platform that is able to provide this aggregation natively.\n\nBridge aggregation with Hyperlane Interchain Security Modules\nWith Hyperlane, users such as Uniswap can specify custom Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), smart contracts which contain the logic to verify their interchain messages.\nThis allows Uniswap to, for example, specify an ISM that requires the following:\n\nVerification of the message by Wormhole\nVerification of the message by Axelar\n4/6 signatures from Hyperlane validators unaffiliated with Uniswap (including well known entities such as Staked, Blockdaemon, Everstake, ZeePrime, and ZK Validator)\nn/m signatures from Hyperlane validators run by designated members of the Uniswap community*\n\nIt’s worth noting that Hyperlane is the only interoperability provider that currently has this type of modular security architecture already in production. The Multisig ISM can be used today, without any additional development required. Additionally the required infrastructure has been open-sourced and there are comprehensive guides and documentation for its operation. Work on the Aggregation ISM has already begun irrespective of Uniswap’s assessment process, as the system was designed to allow for the simple and fast implementation of new security modules.\nAn example for the interface can be seen here:\n/**\n * @notice Manages an ownable set of ISMs that must all verify an interchain\n * message before it is accepted.\n */\ncontract AggregationISM is IInterchainSecurityModule, Ownable {\n  using AggregationIsmMetadata for bytes;\n  using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;\n  \n  EnumerableSet.AddressSet private _isms;\n\n  function addIsm(address _ism) public onlyOwner {\n    require(_isms.add(_ism));\n  }\n\n  function removeIsm(address _ism) public onlyOwner {\n    require(_isms.remove(_ism));\n  }\n\n  function verify(bytes calldata _metadata, bytes calldata _message)\n    public\n    view\n    returns (bool)\n  {\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _isms.length(); i++) {\n      IInterchainSecurityModule _ism = IInterchainSecurityModule(_isms.at(i));\n      require(_ism.verify(_metadata.at(i), _message);\n    }\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n\nUniswap governance would be able to modify this ISM’s configuration over time (or change ISMs entirely). Potential changes to the ISM config include but are not limited to:\n\nRequire a message to pass through an optimistic security model\nAdd additional bridge providers to the aggregation\nRequire particular messages to also be approved by a Gnosis safe**\nModify the unaffiliated-with-Uniswap and/or affiliated-with-Uniswap validator sets\n\n*Running a Hyperlane validator simply requires an AWS account, and RPC connection, and a machine to run on, and can be set up in ~30 minutes without any capital expenditures.\n**This is, in-effect, similar to adding an additional Hyperlane validator set, but with fully offline keys\n\nVendor lock-in\nIf Uniswap were to use Hyperlane for interchain governance, our recommendation would be to use the Interchain Accounts API 4, an interchain application built on top of Hyperlane’s core messaging layer.\nInterchain Accounts extend the control of an account on a local chain (e.g. Ethereum), allowing it to make arbitrary function calls on remote chains.\nBecause Interchain Accounts allow for arbitrary function calls, choosing Hyperlane today to implement the MMA would not prevent Uniswap from migrating to a different solution tomorrow, and it provides the easiest way for Uniswap to incorporate new security options as they materialize, as they each can be expressed as a new ISM.\nTo avoid confusion, we will make a separate post answering the 13 questions submitted by the Foundation.",

Specifically, we do not believe the BNB Chain Deployment Proposal should move forward before more research can be done, even if this may come as a letdown to many community members – be it bridge builders or other individuals.\nInstead, we urge the Uniswap Foundation and the Uniswap community to fully immerse themselves in the Cross-Chain Assessment Process outlined by @devinwalsh. While the sprint to move to BNB Chain before the business license expires is important, we believe finding a long-term solution for cross-chain governance to be far more important than the short-term win of deploying V3 code first. There will be new chains, new versions of Uniswap, but there will never be another chance to expand governance safely and securely on the first try. Uniswap is a market leader in design (AMMs), token structure (airdrops), and overall competency, and LI.FI believes that the model Uniswap chooses for cross-chain governance has a high chance of becoming industry standard. We – as members of the crypto industry – want to see this done the correct way, and from the start.\nBridges, specifically arbitrary messaging bridges (AMBs), are in the nascent stages of development. Short-term, Wormhole, LayerZero, Celer, Axelar and deBridge are certainly viable solutions for cross-chain governance and have received substantial traction in terms of volume at the liquidity layer and development by dApps at the messaging layer.\nThat being said, we at LI.FI have done the research on AMBs (Navigating Arbitrary Messaging Bridges 2) and have delved deeply into the pros and cons of eight different AMB solutions. Our conclusion is simple: no single AMB is tested enough to be considered a robust and secure solution that a project of Uniswap’s size can solely rely on at this point. If there was a single, obvious AMB solution that could be trusted by Uniswap, then this forum post would not be necessary. Lest it be forgotten, two major AMBs were exploited in the past twelve months (Nomad and Wormhole), while LayerZero has also come under fire recently for its security model (Prestwich 3, L2Beat 3). We do not say this as condemnation, rather, we point this out to highlight just how difficult it is to build secure AMBs and the subsequent risks a dApp is exposed to by choosing a single bridging solution. In addition to this sentiment, we believe AMBs like Axelar, Synapse, Hyperlane, Multichain, Connext Amarok, and Hop deserve to be considered by Uniswap and the deadline of two and half weeks is too short for them to be formally introduced, debated, and voted upon again.\nTo summarize, LI.FI stands staunchly behind the concerns previously raised by @Kydo, @AlexSmirnov, and @modong. LI.FI believes that a multi-bridge, agnostic approach is best suited for Uniswap cross-chain governance because of the following reasons:\n\nBy picking one bridging solution, Uniswap will be selecting a winner in a niche that is perhaps yet to find the most optimal solution, resulting in a lack of innovation going forward and a dominance by the AMB that will not help the space move forward in the right direction.\nWith bridges, trust is a spectrum 1, and all the AMBs make different trade-offs resulting in unique strengths and weaknesses. However, when it comes to Uniswap’s use case of cross-chain governance, security can never be a trade-off. This is where a multi-bridge solution comes in to overcome these trust trade-offs, offering better security than any one bridging solution.\nAggregating the best, most trusted AMBs will be in the best interest of the Uniswap community as, irrespective of shortcomings in any individual bridge, Uniswap will always receive the best services required for cross-chain governance.\n\nSo, where do we go from here?\nMore research is in order, which we believe should be two-pronged.\n1. Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Framework\nWe would like to add our own feedback to Devin’s framework and add an additional step to the process.\nThe MMA solution or any other multi-bridge solution is built on the idea of Uniswap choosing multiple bridges as “adapters.” The first thing to do, therefore, is to determine which bridges meet Uniswap standards, as outlined by @devinwalsh.\nWe believe that Uniswap should first build a unique framework to both quantitatively and qualitatively measure and allow for the ranking of different bridge solutions by the engineering team. This would decrease the workload of the engineering team by letting them focus on stress-testing bridge solutions without having to create the parameters of such a test themselves.\nAs one of the largest players in DeFi, Uniswap has the chance to create the de facto bridge assessment criterion.\nBy our estimation, there are four bridge framework solutions currently in the ether.\n\n\nCrosschain Risk Framework 5 – created by ConsenSys & LI.FI\n\n\nL2 Beat Bridge Risk Framework 3 – created by L2Beat\n\nAssessing Blockchain Bridges 4 – created by Joel John\n\nWith Bridges, Trust Is a Spectrum: A Quantified Framework 2 – created by LI.FI and CryptoStats\n\nUniswap has the chance to build upon, combine, and quantify the works of four major research pieces without having to start from scratch.\nWith that in mind, we recommend that Devin’s initial Cross Chain Bridge Assessment make room for four researchers, who can help build this framework to assist the engineering team, who can then test out different bridging solutions based on the criteria mentioned in the framework and select which bridges make the cut to become a part of the multi-bridge solution.\nThe researchers will then explain the decision of the team through easy to digest articles, which can be used by other builders to assess bridges for their own dApps and by users to expand their knowledge of bridges and make more informed decisions when it comes to choosing a bridging solution for their needs. To this end, collaborations with other public good infrastructure projects like L2BEAT, Ethereum.org, among others, should also be considered to spread awareness and educate the public about bridges.\nAs Devin laid out, these individuals should be available for 10-15 hours per week over the next few weeks to participate in the assessment process, and to write up their findings in a report to share with the community.\nTo this end, we recommend Peter Robinson 6, Arjun Chand 4, Ermyas Abebe 2, and Bartek Kiepuszewski 1 (though we believe Uniswap should have the final call here).\nWe believe the current timeframe is aggressive but doable. However, if the list of bridges were to expand, we would recommend pushing back the March 27th date.\n\n826×445 22.2 KB\n\n2. Consideration of Making the Universal Governance Model 1 an EIP\nUniswap pushing for a cross-chain governance EIP would be net positive for the industry, in our opinion, specifically in the context of a multi-bridge solution. Such an EIP would give dApps a shared template for creating safe, secure governance modules, while also giving flexibility for dApps to choose different bridging solutions based on their security, time, and cost preferences.\nTo that end, we believe that Uniswap should create and propose a new cross-chain EIP based on the design outlined by Mo Dong from Celer and Alex from deBridge (with, of course, any tweaks recommended by the engineering and research team).\n\n1035×540 116 KB\n\nAdditionally, there are two EIPs and one forum post that Uniswap should consider learning from and building upon in addition to the framework above.\n\n\nEIP 5164, as explained by Brendan Asseltine, is a PoolTogether and Hop-backed EIP looking to standardize governance message passing. While EIP 5164 is not a perfect fit for Uniswap – it proposes that all bridges provide the same interface to apps so that apps can just build against this interface and choose one bridge later – it does provide insight into the difficulties that EIP writers will have in coming up with a single design.\n\nEIP 6170 2, is a common smart contract interface for interacting with messaging protocols.\n\nPrincipled approach to bridges 1, proposes block header based bridges.\n\nIn our estimation, none of these solutions have captured enough mindshare to become industry standard. However, they have all pushed the envelope in what can be done in standardizing messaging, and Uniswap could learn much from it.\nWe recommend that Uniswap employ the same four-engineering team to standardize the MMA solution as an EVM-compatible EIP.\nGiven Uniswap’s position and influence in the ecosystem, it has the power to push an EIP that can potentially become the de-facto solution for any project indulging in cross-chain governance.\nConclusion\nA multi-bridge, agnostic solution that the community invests resources into is a win-win-win for all the parties involved (Uniswap, bridging solutions, and the dApps that will implement this solution for cross-chain governance in the future).\nAs Devin said, the developments as a result of the proposed deployment on BNB Chain are net-positive for the ecosystem. Open discussions about bridge designs and frameworks for assessing security risks associated with them are exactly what we need to fast-forward the maturity of the bridging solutions and enable development of secure bridges.\nWe look forward to the feedback of the UF and the community on our proposal.",

        "replyFullContent": "Hi everyone, Multichain 5 here. Multichain is an infrastructure developed for arbitrary cross-chain interactions. We are secured by MPC and ZKP, and we are envisioned to be the ultimate router for Web3.\nWe sincerely hope that we can help and contribute to the Uniswap community by working together with you.\nAnd here are the answers to the 15 questions from us:\n1. List 3 succinct reasons why you believe your bridge/solution would best serve Uniswap governance.\na. The most significant reason for Multichain’s superior security is its foundation in Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), a theory developed and validated by some of the world’s most renowned cryptographers. The key algorithm implemented at the heart of Multichain’s cross-chain bridge and router is the Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS 1). These nodes are independent entities that can collectively sign transactions. Using a Distributed Key Generation algorithm, each node independently owns part of the private key shards. The complete set of private keys will never appear, let alone the possibility of being revealed. This can avoid single points of failure, and enhance decentralization and security. The underlying MPC structure design, combined with a wealth of experience in building cross-chain bridges and an abundant supply of liquidity, allows us to offer the cheapest cross-chain fees as well.\nb. We are proud to have created the largest cross-chain infrastructure ecosystem, with over 3000 bridges built for our partners and support for more than 80 networks, including both well-known EVM chains and non-EVM chains. Our platform has an excellent number of daily active users, especially on BNB chain. We believe that our strong presence in the BNB community will greatly benefit Uniswap users who are looking to expand their network reach.\nc. Innovation is at the core of Multichain’s mission, and we are proud to be the pioneers in cross-chain technology. We were the first to establish a bridge in the crypto space, and we continue to innovate with the launch of RouterV3 4, which enables native asset bridging. We also led the way in NFT bridging and developed the cross-chain message protocol, anyCall. Most recently, we launched zkRouter 2, which offers users the option to utilize ZK technology, in addition to our MPC option. Our commitment to innovation and exploration means that the Uniswap community can expect even more exciting developments from Multichain in the future.\n2. How long has the system been running on mainnet?\nMultichain was born on July 20th, 2020, under the name Anyswap. We have been running on the mainnet for 2 years, 6 months. Our focus has always been on addressing the need for distinct and diverse blockchains to communicate with each other seamlessly.\nFrom the outset, our main product has been the asset cross-chain bridge, which has undergone several iterations and was later upgraded to become the core cross-chain solution, Router. We also developed an NFT cross-chain solution, which further expanded the capabilities of our platform.\nAt Multichain, we are committed to building and improving our cross-chain infrastructure to provide the best possible experience for our users.\nIn addition to promoting interoperability across different networks and facilitating smooth asset and value transfers, Multichain also enables seamless data and message transmission across chains. In April 2022, Multichain launched anyCall, a general cross-chain messaging protocol that allows for arbitrary cross-chain messaging.\nMultichain has been running successfully for almost three years now. Earlier this year, we released the zkRouter whitepaper, which is an important component of Multichain’s inter-chain trust layer public infrastructure. In the near future, applications (such as cross-chain bridges) built on zkRouter will be available to the public.\n3. How much value has the system secured? (Current TVL, total transaction volume)\na. Bridge & Router TVL：$1.78 B\nb. Total transaction volume: $ 97.73 B\n4. Provide a background on your team.\nAs an exceptional international team, the members of Multichain share a common vision and contribute their unique skills to the project. Established in 2020, Multichain comprises experts from diverse backgrounds in engineering, cryptography, economics, and mathematics. The team is united in their pursuit of becoming the ultimate Web3 router.\nThe technical members have extensive experience in the blockchain industry and have collaborated for over a decade. Notably, Andre Cronje 3 serves as the architecture advisor of Multichain and is widely recognized as a pioneer in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi). In 2020, Cronje created yearn.finance and Keep3rV1, in addition to contributing to other notable DeFi projects. Moreover, he has played a critical role in shaping Multichain’s technical architecture designs.\nMultichain has also garnered numerous contributors from MultiDAO. The DAO is dedicated to achieving the Multichainverse and supporting Multichain in its mission.\n5. Please link your developer documentation.\na. https://docs.multichain.org/getting-started/introduction 1\nb. https://multidao.gitbook.io/anycall/the-latest-version/v7/how-to-integrate-anycall-v7\n6. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\nYes. We do offer a cross-chain messaging protocol called anyCall, which has been operating reliably for over a year. Our esteemed partners, such as Curve, have leveraged anyCall to enhance their cross-chain LP rewards distribution governance.  Under the hood, anyCall is powered by the MPC network, and its security is fortified by MPC cryptography. In addition, we have recently introduced zkRouter testnet, which allows messages to be transmitted in a trustless and decentralized manner. By incorporating ZK technology with advanced cryptography and mathematics, zkRouter has eliminated the dependence on trust in the cross-chain process. Compared to other cross-chain bridges in the space, zkRouter provides a new level of security that’s unparalleled.\n7. Has the current deployed bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?\nMultichain has completed comprehensive audits on all of our products, and we are pleased to make the audit reports available to the public. Audit reports can be seen here: GitHub - anyswap/Anyswap-Audit 1. Our audit report repository contains a total of 13 third-party audits, including those conducted by esteemed companies in web3 such as TrailOfBits, CertiK, SlowMist, and BlockSec. The audits identified primarily contract issues, though their severity was generally low. We encourage you to review the aforementioned audit report repository for further details. Any vulnerabilities identified during the audit process have been remedied and reviewed by the auditing companies.\nSecurity is one of the highest priorities at Multichain. Multichain has built long-term partnerships with world-leading third-party code auditing companies to conduct code auditing of every version or important update of codes. Multichain also has dedicated 10% of its revenues to a security insurance fund and has two bug bounty programs — one with Immunefi and the other internal.\nMultichain has established an academic alliance with leading international cryptography experts who specialize in threshold signature algorithms and MPC in order to keep up with recent advancements in related technologies and drive technological progress.\n8. Is there a bug bounty program?\nYes. We have partnered with Immunefi to establish a bug bounty 1 program of up to $2 million. In addition, we have set up a dedicated security mailbox to receive bug disclosures that do not meet the requirements of the Immunefi plan. Furthermore, we have established security partnerships with other industry partners, such as Binance & Multichain’s War Room, to share information about vulnerabilities and security experiences and to create stronger security measures for the industry.\nTo date, we have issued bug rewards totalling more than $2 million, which has effectively raised the security level of Multichain products. We have also created a security fund to alleviate users’ concerns about security during cross-chain transactions.\n9. List ANY portion of the functional bridge that is upgradeable and explain how the upgrade process works.\nWe do not have upgradeable portions for security reasons. This is to prevent contracts from being accidentally or maliciously upgraded by attackers, potentially leading to asset loss or abnormal functions. By disabling the upgrade feature, we ensure that the contracts remain secure and stable.\n10. Do any contracts have an owner or owner-like entity? If so, what can the owner do?\nOne of the fundamental design principles of Multichain cross-chain contracts is to minimize single-point risks and reduce the attack surface. Unlike traditional contracts, cross-chain contracts have no owner, which adds an extra layer of security. In fact, all Multichain addresses are generated and managed by the MPC network, eliminating the need for an individual or entity to hold ownership. Furthermore, these MPC addresses do not possess a private key, and as a result, there is no single point of failure or vulnerability.\n11. What is the security model of the bridge? Please describe the security model for the current implementation of the bridge. What trust assumptions are you making?\nAt present, our Bridge, Router, and AnyCall products are based on a distributed MPC network security model. Additionally, our latest development, zkRouter, is based on zero-knowledge proof technology.\nA distributed MPC network is a distributed asset control network implemented with cryptography. It aligns with the decentralized philosophy of blockchain, where nodes hold private key shards. When the number of nodes that agree to sign reaches a predefined threshold, multiple nodes collaborate to generate a signature, completing cross-chain asset or message transfers. It is important to note that the process of distributed key generation and signature generation ensures that the private key never appears in its complete form, and the security of the process is guaranteed by cryptographic algorithms. Furthermore, Multichain’s MPC network uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) that offers dedicated security isolation hardware, further enhancing security.\nzkRouter, on the other hand, is based on zero-knowledge proof technology. It generates zero-knowledge proofs based on the source chain’s consensus results, which are then passed on to the target chain for verification, thereby completing cross-chain transfers. The rigorous mathematical derivation and secure cryptography in the zero-knowledge proofs ensure that no one or entity can act maliciously, and as long as at least one honest participant is present in the system, cross-chain transfers can occur securely. Even in extreme case where all participants are malicious, the system cannot be compromised.\nIn summary, a distributed MPC network is based on cryptography, while zkRouter is based on zero-knowledge proof technology, which combines cryptography and mathematics.\n12. How can an adversary pass a fraudulent message from Ethereum to the destination chain? Please give specific and concrete examples.\nCurrently, Multichain’s asset cross-chain bridge and router rely on the SMPC-based MPC Network to process cross-chain messages. The MPC Network is composed of independent nodes that verify the message status of the source chain and participate in the subsequent TSS execution based on their own verification results. TSS is a strong consensus determined by cryptography, which can only be completed when a threshold number of MPC nodes participate at the same time, otherwise, there is no result.\nTherefore, in order for an adversary to transmit incorrect messages from Ethereum to the target chain while Ethereum is running normally, he must first control an MPC node to initiate a TSS request and inject the incorrect information into the MPC network, thus forging the incorrect information. The execution of TSS then requires the adversary to simultaneously control more than 2/3 of the nodes in the MPC network to complete the action.\nMultichain has recently released a solution based on ZKP technology to solve the problem of trust in cross-chain communication called zkRouter. zkRouter relies on ZKP technology to generate proof of Ethereum’s consensus result, and proof of any result not agreed upon by Ethereum’s consensus cannot be generated and verified. The proof supports independent verification and can be completed by on-chain contracts after being passed to the target chain.\nIn this case, an adversary cannot achieve his goal of tampering with information by attacking either the proof generator or the transmitter. The only path is to challenge the security strength of Ethereum’s consensus mechanism and write incorrect information into Ethereum’s consensus result by attacking Ethereum.\n13. How can an adversary withhold a valid governance message from Ethereum to the destination chain? Please give specific and concrete examples.\nRegarding the trust mechanism of MPC, under the normal operation of Ethereum, there are three ways to try to withhold governance information on Ethereum.\nThe first way is to withhold the message from being transmitted to the MPC network, which will not trigger the execution of subsequent TSS. Since all MPC nodes can act as initiators of TSS requests, the adversary needs to disable the network of all nodes simultaneously, or attack or control all nodes simultaneously and make them refuse service or become paralyzed.\nThe second way is to block the node’s access to governance messages on Ethereum by disabling the node’s network, attacking or controlling the node. If more than 1/3 of the nodes are blocked, the MPC Network cannot complete the TSS execution normally, thus achieving the adversary’s goal of withholding governance messages on Ethereum.\nThe third way is to control more than 2/3 of the MPC nodes after TSS generation and prevent them from sending the TSS result to the target chain to withhold governance messages. In future plans, the MPC Network will be upgraded to MPC Blockchain, and anyone can send the TSS result to the target chain, making it impossible to withhold governance messages from Ethereum through the TSS transmission path.\nRegarding the trust mechanism of zkRouter, there are also two ways for an adversary to withhold governance messages on Ethereum.\nThe first way is to block zkRouter from successfully obtaining governance messages on chain, either by disabling the network of all Relayer nodes that obtains messages in zkRouter, or by controlling all Relayer nodes so that they cannot obtain or respond to governance messages. Or by disabling all node services that provide transaction queries on Ethereum, so that Relayer has no way to obtain governance messages.\nThe second way is to disable Ethereum network and so that governance messages cannot be confirmed by consensus or Ethereum’s consensus result is tampered with.\nAttacking the transmission of proof to the target chain in zkRouter is ineffective, as long as the target chain is working normally, anyone can send proof to the target chain.\n14. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor(s)? If it is legal ramification, please share the suite of legal action you can provide. If it is slashing, please point us to the codebase of the slashing behaviour and describe in words how slashing works in your system.\nThe security of Multichain is upheld by the MPC network, a group of trusted nodes. Additionally, the application project has the flexibility to either run its own MPC node or choose a trusted node to form the TSS threshold. Running an MPC node requires a certain amount of veMULTI to be locked up.\nMultichain released the zkRouter. The main purpose of zkRouter is to solve the problem of inter-chain consensus verification. Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms that rely on node agreement, ZKP technology only requires one honest node to relay proofs for secure cross-chain communication. Malicious nodes cannot generate valid proofs, ensuring that the trustless security model can reduce dependence on trusted nodes. Once the conversion to zkRouter has been made, then the question of slashing would not apply.\n15. Provide any additional information you would like here.\nHow Multichain can contribute to the Uniswap community:\na. zkRouter: Following the launch of zkRouter by Multichain, we plan to dedicate to upgrading the MPC bridge to zkRouter bridge specifically for the Uniswap community in the near future.\nb. BNB chain: Multichain offers a significant advantage on BNB. Currently, Multichain’s TVL stands at $1.84 billion, with $326.24 million TVL on the BNB chain alone. This figure accounts for 17.73% of Multichain’s overall TVL. Multichain’s total volume on all supported chains is $97.78 billion, with $12.5 billion total volume on the BNB chain. This translates to a 12.78% share of Multichain’s total volume, which is significant given the platform’s overall size. Additionally, Multichain allows for easy integration with the BNB chain and supports connections to 30 other chains. Notably, a number of 900 tokens have been bridged to BNB chain via Multichain.\nWhen compared to other cross-chain bridges currently available in the market, Multichain stands out for its extensive support of public chains and asset types, as well as the vast scale of assets on its chain. In the case of BNB chain, Multichain’s data outperforms other similar protocols by a large margin. Details can be seen in the figure below.\n\nScreen Shot 2023-02-16 at 17.01.431912×434 160 KB\n\nIn summary, we are confident that Multichain has the potential to bring significant benefits to the Uniswap community and achieve great success.",

We strongly believe that the future is going to be cross-chain and Uniswap’s governance layer is going to be the first large-scale implementation of a cross-chain messaging protocol.\nLast year bridges contributed to a lot of hacks and moving forward, large-scale adoption and usage after proper due diligence is needed to restore the trust of the wider community in bridges — because they are inevitable as different layer1s and layer2s emerge and continue to fragment communities and liquidity.\nWe like the idea of the multibridge aggregator because that would enable the system to be more secure and the requirement of obtaining a quorum on top of the bridges without making Uniswap have to lock in with one bridge. The solution would be very relevant for high-value projects like Uniswap which have a large amount of liquidity to secure.\nHence, we are raising a PR request to add Router Protocol into the Multi-Bridge implementation.\nThe PR link is: added Router Protocol adapters by Shivam78288 · Pull Request #235 · celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts · GitHub 9\nSome background about Router Protocol: We are a cross-chain interoperability layer backed by the likes of Coinbase, Polygon, and Wintermute.

Please link your developer documentation.\nThe documentation is available here: https://devnet-docs.routerprotocol.com/ 1 and the white paper is available here: Whitepaper 3\n6. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\nYes, we support arbitrary message passing. The best way to send arbitrary messages between different blockchains is Router CrossTalk.\nRouter crosstalk is the framework that can be used to pass messages across chains. In simple terms, this library leverages Router’s infrastructure to allow contracts on one chain to pass instructions to contracts deployed on another chain without needing to deploy any contracts on the Router chain. The library is structured in a way that it can be integrated seamlessly into your development environment to allow for cross-chain message passing without disturbing other parts of your product.\n7. Has the currently deployed bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?\nThe V1 bridge was audited 3 by multiple auditors - Halborn Security, Hacken, and Oak Security.\nAll the vulnerabilities in the V1 architecture were fixed as part of the audit process.\nThe current v2 architecture which we are proposing to use for this integration is still in devnet phase with testnet planned around April and Mainnet around July. We will be getting Router V2 audited by veteran auditors like Informal Systems, Oak security, Zokyo etc.\n8. Is there a bug bounty program?\nWe run a security bug bounty on ImmuneFi for Router v1 and the same will continue once we open up Router v2 for audit and security process. We have rewards upto $200,000 available for the Immunefi bug bounty program.\n9. List ANY portion of the functional bridge that is upgradeable and explain how the upgrade process works.\nAs of now, the contract is upgradeable in the devnet phase. But on mainnet, it will be upgradeable with the ⅔ voting consensus on the router chain.\nHence, effectively a governance vote will be required to upgrade contracts in the mainnet.\n10. Do any contracts have an owner or owner-like entity? If so, what can the owner do?\nWe do have an owner-like entity. It can only modify the base bridge fee that dApps need to pay for a cross-chain transaction on the source chain and do emergency pause. Pause is majorly added so that we can stop the bridge in case a chain is hacked for that particular chain.\n11. What is the security model of the bridge? Please describe the security model for the current implementation of the bridge. What trust assumptions are you making?\nIn Router v2, the Router chain acts as the bridge. Router chain is built using the cosmos SDK. Hence, it leverages tendermint’s Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine. As a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, the Router chain is primarily run by a network of validators with economic incentives to act honestly. The trust assumption is that there will be ⅔+1 validators who will act honestly.\nHowever, we will be providing customizability to dApps to add their own security layer on top of the PoS-based mechanism inherited by default from the Router chain. DApps can add optimistic layers as well to make their system more secure.\n12. How can an adversary pass a fraudulent message from Ethereum to the destination chain? Please give specific and concrete examples.\nFor an adversary to pass a fraudulent message — they will have to control ⅔+1 stake of the Router consensus. The security is based on the PoS scheme.\n13. How can an adversary withhold a valid governance message from Ethereum to the destination chain? Please give specific and concrete examples.\nThere are 2 ways to block the governance from Ethereum.\nThe first way is by attacking the network of the orchestrators and making them paralyzed. This would mean that the request would never get created on the Router chain for further execution and hence, block the message from Ethereum to the destination chain.\nThe second way is to gain control of ⅓ orchestrators / validators. If ⅓ or more validators are blocked from voting or vote incorrectly we will not be able to achieve consensus and hence. the message will not get executed on the destination chain.\n14. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor(s)? If it is legal ramification, please share the suite of legal action you can provide. If it is slashing, please point us to the codebase of the slashing behavior and describe in words how slashing works in your system.\nValidators have to stake $ROUTE tokens on the Router chain. Any validator having excessive downtime or engaging in any kind of malicious activity is penalized by having a portion of their staked ROUTE slashed.\nFor attack vectors like double signing, validators liveness, we use cosmos sdk slashing module which is described here x/slashing | Cosmos SDK 1\nWhile for attack vectors like cross chain message tampering, message withholding etc we will be implementing our custom slashing mechanism which will be available in testnet phase in April.\n15.
